Existing studies mostly use multiple deep learning models to extract multivariate semantic features to capture different levels of semantic information in the text; however, the simple splicing of these features causes information redundancy and noise, limiting detection accuracy and generalization, and effective deep fusion methods are not available. In addition, existing studies tend to ignore the impact of dual sentiments co-constructed by news content and its corresponding comments on revealing news authenticity. This paper proposes a Dual Emotion and Multi-feature Fusion based Fake News Detection (DEMF-FND) model to address these problems. First, the emotional features of news and comments are extracted by emotion analysis. The emotional difference features reflecting the correlation between the two are introduced using similarity computation, and a dual emotion feature set is constructed. Subsequently, a fusion mechanism based on multihead attention is used to deeply fuse the global and local semantic features of the news text captured by a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with a designed Integrated Static-Dynamic Embedded Convolutional Neural Network (ISDE-CNN). Eventually, the dual emotion feature set is concatenated with the semantic features obtained by deep fusion and fed into a classification layer consisting of a fully connected layer, to determine news authenticity. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline method in terms of benchmark metrics on three real datasets, namely Weibo20, Twitter15, and Twitter16, and achieves 2.5, 2.3, and 5.5 percentage points improvements in accuracy, respectively, highlighting the importance of dual emotion and the deep fusion of semantic features in enhancing the performance of fake news detection. © 2025, Editorial Office of Computer Engineering.

Although these terminologies have different objectives, they share the aim of causing harm in the form of fake news. This study presents an Arabic fake news detection framework to overcome the widespread fake news phenomenon. The proposed framework introduces the first Arabic fake news dataset compiled by passing through strict guidelines to produce fake articles composed by humans and the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT). First, we performed human-based experiments to evaluate the ability of humans to distinguish real news articles from fake news articles. Our findings reveal that humans could roughly identify half of the fake articles from humans or GPT, raising concerns about their ability to detect fake news. This highlights the growing concern surrounding fake news, especially because GPT demonstrates the ability to generate fake news that closely resembles human-created content, further amplifying the issue. To address this issue, we performed the same task using Deep Learning (DL) and transformer-based methods with different word embeddings. Across all the employed models, the study revealed that the innovative transformer-based model, ARBERT, outperformed the DL models, reaching an accuracy of 78% in classifying real and fake news generated by humans and GPT.

As misinformation spreads rapidly, automated detection systems are essential to mitigate its impact. However, most existing methods rely solely on textual analysis, limiting their effectiveness. The challenge is further compounded by the lack of a large-scale, multimodal dataset for Bangla fake news detection, as existing datasets are either small or unimodal. To address this, we introduce MultiBanFakeDetect, a novel multimodal dataset integrating both textual and visual information. This dataset comprises manually curated real and fake news samples from various online sources. Additionally, we propose MultiFusionFake, a hybrid multimodal fake news detection framework that fuses text and image modalities using an Early Fusion approach while also comparing Late and Intermediate fusion techniques. Our experiments show that MultiFusionFake, combining DenseNet-169 and mBERT, achieves 79.69% accuracy, outperforming the text-only mBERT model's 73.13%, reflecting a 6.56 percentage point improvement. These results underscore the advantages of multimodal over unimodal methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on multimodal fake news detection in the under-resourced Bangla context, offering a promising approach to combating online misinformation. © 2025 The Authors","Bangla language; Deep learning; Fake news detection; Fusion techniques; Multimodal dataset; Textual analysis; Under-resource; Visual analysis","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008279941"

Some existing studies, although capturing the consistency and inconsistency features between different modalities, neglect to dynamically balance these two types of features based on their contributions during the features fusion. Thus, we propose a Semantic Relationship-based Consistency and Inconsistency Balancing Network for multimodal fake news detection (SR-CIBN). Specifically, the global features are thoroughly investigated by hierarchically penetrating and interacting between multimodal features that are aligned by contrastive learning at both the intra- and inter-modal views. Then, the global consistency and inconsistency features are obtained through the interaction between the selected key image patches features and the global features. Additionally, the fusion intensity of the global consistency and inconsistency features is adjusted based on the image–text matching degree, resulting in the final optimized features. Under the joint learning framework we proposed, confusion between semantically similar real and fake news is effectively avoided by training with triplet loss based on the image–text semantic relationship. Our model surpasses comparable approaches, as shown by comprehensive experiments on the Twitter and Weibo datasets. © 2025","Contrastive learning; Deep learning; Fake news detection; Multimodal fusion","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000182416"

Extensive experiments on two multimodal classification tasks, fake news detection and sentiment analysis, demonstrate that UMCF can extract multimodal data features and achieve superior classification performance than task-specific benchmarks.

Compared to CNN (1.3395 s, 72.0819%) and BiGRU (0.5518 s, 73.9547%), the EPRVFL ensures significantly faster inference with competitive accuracy. While BiLSTM achieves a higher precision (98.3471%) on PolitiFact, it requires 0.7674 s, making it less efficient in real-time scenarios. Similarly, FFNN shows the fastest inference (0.1103 s) but struggles with accuracy (59.4595%) on BuzzFeed-Webis. The proposed model's balanced performance across precision, recall and F1 scores reinforces its robustness in fake news detection. The proposed EPRVFL model uniquely integrates BERT-base embeddings with a lightweight neural structure, ensuring rapid inference while maintaining robust accuracy, making it ideal for real-time applications.

Current solutions propose the principle of static feature extraction, the dependence on a single classifier, or modest results that do not meet the requirements in today's environment with its complexity of data. As a result of these, this study presents the Adaptive Ensemble Classifier (AEC), a new ensemble system that consists of hybrid decision trees and Support Vector Machine (SVM) similar to margin optimization for the improvement of classification performance. The proposed AEC incorporates several innovative features: dynamic feature selection through adaptive neighbourhood selection based on feature importance, SVM-based refinement of decision boundaries for improved precision, and a weighted ensemble voting mechanism to ensure robust predictions. In addition, to ensuring explain ability, the system uses LIME and SHAP to provide probability-based explanations for the predictions and the features that influence the results. The performance of the AEC is evaluated using public datasets such as the Fake News dataset and cross-domain performance using COVID-19 Fake News Dataset. Experimental results confirmed that the proposed model achieved an impressive accuracy of 99.74% compared to traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models in particular in aspects of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The computational efficiency is also evaluated by comparing training time, memory usage, peak memory usage, inference time, and model size with existing models. The interpretability offered by LIME focuses on the most important features that affect predictions, which makes the system more useful in real-world situations. Finally, the different statistical analysis tests are also employed on proposed AEC and existing ML and DL models such as Paired t-test, Kruskal-Wallis, Dunn's, Bootstrap Resampling, Cohen's d Effect Size and Confidence Intervals.

Fake news has the ability to evolve and create huge difficulties for human detection. Therefore, machine learning-based approaches to differentiate fake and real news have emerged as a predominant strategy. Historically, many previous content-based deep learning methods struggle with new types of fake news due to their reliance on static learned patterns. As a result, recent approaches have shifted to using Graph Neural Network (GNN) to include a more comprehensive context and prior knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a novel and robust framework that combines GNN and energy-based learning. Specifically, by leveraging the energy score in updating the trainable cost function, our method maximizes the energy gap between real and fake news, significantly enhancing detection performance. The experimental results demonstrate our promising output compared to that of state-of-the-art methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.","Energy-based model; Evidence-based fake news detection; Graph neural network","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008639038"

However, most recent efforts only focus on the features of news content and social context without realizing the benefits of large language models (LLMs) and multiple knowledge graphs (KGs), thus failing to improve detection capabilities further. To tackle this issue, we present a multiknowledge and LLM-inspired heterogeneous graph neural network for fake news detection (MiLk-FD), by combining KGs, LLMs, and graph neural networks (GNNs). Specifically, we first model news content as a heterogeneous graph (HG) containing news, entity, and topic nodes and then fuse the knowledge from three KGs to augment the factual basis of news articles. Meanwhile, we leverage TransE to initialize the knowledge features and employ LLaMa2-7B to obtain the initial feature vectors of news articles. After that, we utilize the devised HG transformer to learn news embeddings with specific feature distribution in high-dimensional spaces by aggregating neighborhood information according to metapaths. Finally, a classifier based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) is trained to predict each news article as fake or true. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed framework surpasses ten baselines according to accuracy, precision, F1-score, recall, and ROC in four public real-world benchmarks (i.e., COVID-19, FakeNewsNet, PAN2020, Liar). © 2014 IEEE.","Deep learning; fake news detection; graph anomaly detection; knowledge graph (KG); large language model (LLM)","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002385336"

Existing deep learning-based solutions typically involve designing hierarchical models that capture relevant features from each modality, which are then fused for final classification. However, these models are often complex, with numerous trainable parameters, making them resource-intensive. This work introduces the Deep Learning Model with Evolutionary Computing Approach (DLECA), a novel method for compressing and optimizing hierarchical deep learning models (HDLM). It employs an enhanced genetic algorithm (GA) with a unique fitness function, dynamic crossover, and adaptive mutation strategies to achieve model compression, maintain accuracy, and balance exploration and exploitation during evolution. In comparison to manually designed HDLM, the proposed approach achieves up to 97.86% model compression with a 0.34% accuracy improvement, while a variant achieves 96.24% compression with a 0.23% accuracy improvement. Comparative analysis shows that DLECA outperforms Random Walk and Bayesian Optimization in multimodal fake news detection, offering a more efficient and accurate solution. © 2024 The Authors.","Deep Learning; Evolutionary computing; Genetic Algorithms; model compression; model optimization","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008989948"

They undermine confidence in the media in general. Nowadays, it has never been easier to disseminate “fake news” especially through social networks. Given the high stakes involved, determining truth in social media has recently become an emerging research that is attracting tremendous attention. Current NLP algorithms are still missing the interpretation of the news. Therefore, using approaches based on news content challenges the detection of fake news’ characteristics; we need auxiliary information to help make a determination. ‘Social-context-based’ and ‘propagation-based’ approaches can be an alternative or complementary strategy to content-based approaches. This paper surveys the work on Arabic fake news detection methods and techniques. Particularly, we identify the details related to the fundamental theories across various disciplines by situating their usage within current opinion mining techniques in social media to encourage interdisciplinary research on Arabic fake news. An exhaustive review of Arabic fake news detection techniques on social media is presented, including the task definition, the different approaches and the various deep learning approaches applied. This survey can facilitate the collaboration of efforts among experts from different disciplines such as in computer sciences, social sciences and political science to research fake news. In addition, this study explores the emerging trends and the different applications of Arabic fake news detection on social media.

This may lead to the spread of misinformation which negatively impacts society, politics, and the economy. The term fake news is coined to refer to this misinformation. Therefore, developing a model for fake news detection is essential because manual fact-checking is unfeasible due to an exponential increase in the amount of internet material. As the main mode of information involved is of textual form hence a key aspect of this process is creating an effective feature vector, which converts raw text data into a numerical format that machine learning models can process. In this study, three techniques for feature vector representation are used. Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF) which is a traditional statistical technique, Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers (BERT) which are more advanced deep learning-based embeddings. The feature vectors formed were then paired with machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), logistic regression (LR), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to classify fake news and develop a prediction model. Our experiments revealed that combining deep learning embeddings with XGBoost produced the best results (94.98% accuracy, 94.71% precision, 94.98% recall) for detecting fake news. © 2026 selection and editorial matter, Dr. Poonam Nandal, Dr. Mamta Dahiya, Dr. Meeta Singh, Dr. Arvind Dagur, Dr. Brijesh Kumar.

In this work, we propose a large-scale Indian news dataset for the Hindi language. This dataset is constructed by scraping different reliable fact-checking websites. The LDA approach is adopted to assign the category to news statements. Various machine-learning and transfer learning approaches are applied to verify the authenticity of the dataset. Ensemble learning is also applied based on the low false-positive rate of machine-learning classifiers. A multi-modal approach is adopted by combining LSTM with VGG-16 and VGG-19 classifiers.

This paper investigates the efficacy of GNNs with an attention mechanism in identifying false news using the UPFD dataset. The GNN model, augmented with attention, demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional models and deep learning techniques. Leveraging the attention mechanism allows the model to dynamically weigh contextual data, resulting in enhanced accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The study highlights the importance of relational data in bolstering fake news detection systems. Additionally, considerations are made for model optimization, including node preparation and retweet handling, to mitigate overfitting issues. While the attention-enhanced GNN outperforms other models on the UPFD dataset, alternative models such as SAGE show promise on larger datasets like Gossipcop.

With the majority of current social media content being a combination of images and text, there has been an increasing interest in multimodal fake news detection methods. However, existing multimodal fake news detection methods often overlook the complementary role of consistency at different levels. Moreover, they cannot ensure isotropic calculation space when measuring consistency. This paper proposes SSA-MFND, a multimodal fake news detection model based on semantic space alignment. To fully integrate the information from each modality, the model compares the semantic consistency between the description layer and the entity layer, projecting the semantic representation into isotropic space before the semantic consistency calculation. Additionally, our model leverages semantic consistency comparisons at both the description and entity levels, addressing a critical gap in current multimodal methods that typically consider only one level of consistency. Experimental results show that the model achieves an improved accuracy of 2% compared to the state-of-the-art on the microblog dataset. Incorporating semantic hierarchical information and projecting the semantic space before computation greatly enhances the accuracy of fake news detection. The SSA-MFND model can be effectively applied to social media platforms, aiding in the automated detection of fake information and reducing the spread of misleading content. This application not only helps improve the quality of content on the platform but also protects users from the influence of false information. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Data mining; Deep learning; Fake news detection; Semantic consistency calculation","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010680723"

Detecting fake news is crucial for maintaining trust and ensuring access to factual information. While deep learning offers solutions, most approaches focus on the text, neglecting the potential of visual information, which may contradict or misrepresent the accompanying text. This research proposes a multimodal classification approach that combines text and images to improve fake news detection, particularly in low-resource settings where labeled data is scarce. We leverage CLIP, a model that understands relationships between images and text, to extract features from both modalities. These features are concatenated and fed into a simple one-layer multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for classification. To enhance data efficiency, we apply LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, to the CLIP model. We also explore the effects of integrating features from other models. The model achieves an 83% accuracy when using LoRA in classifying whether an image and its accompanying text constitute fake or factual news. These results highlight the potential of multimodal learning and efficient fine-tuning techniques for robust fake news detection, even with limited data. © 2025 Setiawan et al.

The outpour of biased news and propaganda on online portals can be addressed by restricting online propaganda using an automated mechanism. Proving the authenticity of news and information on online platforms in regional languages, such as Urdu, with limited resources and datasets, is challenging. Furthermore, limited research in resource-constrained languages has created language bias in Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, which is concentrated in this study. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have been used for Fake News Detection (FND) for English news and various language-related tasks. Previous studies used Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and individual Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for Urdu FND. ML-based ensemble model showed better performance than pre-trained models for Urdu FND. We propose a methodology for Urdu FND by applying stacked ensemble learning of PLMs, ELECTRA, mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa after apposite fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization. To overcome the limitations of each pre-trained transformer model, these are fine-tuned individually using a publicly available Urdu dataset. The prediction performance results of the proposed stacking approach surpass the performance of each pre-trained model. An Accuracy of 0.914, a Matthews Correlation Co-efficient (MCC) value of 0.898, and an F1-score of 0.904 validate the efficacy of the proposed ensemble model. © The Author(s) 2025.","","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000141707"

Following the PRISMA guidelines, we examined 90 peer-reviewed studies published between 2020 and 2024 to evaluate model effectiveness, identify limitations, and highlight emerging trends. Our analysis shows that deep learning models, particularly transformer-based architectures such as BERT, consistently outperform traditional machine learning methods, often achieving high accuracy (Acc), precision (P), recall (R), and F1-score (F1). For instance, a BERT-based model reported up to 99.9% accuracy on the Kaggle fake news dataset and above 98% on other public datasets, including ISOT, Fake-or-Real, and D3. Similarly, the GANM model demonstrated robust performance on the FakeNewsNet dataset by integrating text and social features. Transfer learning and multimodal models that incorporate user behaviour and network information significantly improve detection in diverse and low-resource environments. However, challenges persist in terms of dataset quality, model interpretability, domain generalisability, and real-time deployment. This review also underscores the limited adoption of few-shot and zero-shot learning techniques, highlighting a promising direction for future research on handling emerging misinformation with minimal training data. To support practical deployment, we advocate the development of explainable, multilingual, and lightweight models with a greater emphasis on human-centred evaluation and ethical considerations.

New methods for detecting and mitigating fake news are required to address this issue. In this work, we propose incorporating contextual and network-aware features into the detection process. This involves analyzing not only the content of a news article but also the context in which it was shared and the network of users who shared it, i.e., the information diffusion. Thus, we propose GETAE, Graph Information Enhanced Deep Neural NeTwork Ensemble ArchitecturE for Fake News Detection, a novel ensemble architecture that uses textual content together with the social interactions to improve fake news detection. GETAE contains two Branches: the Text Branch and the Propagation Branch. The Text Branch combines Word and Transformer embeddings with a Deep Neural Network architecture based on feed-forward and bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks ([BI]RNN) to capture contextual features and generate a Text Content Embedding. This integrated approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the textual information. The Propagation Branch considers the information propagation within the graph network and proposes a Deep Learning architecture that employs Node Embeddings to create novel Propagation Embedding. GETAE's Ensemble module combines the Text Content and Propagation Embeddings, to create a powerful and unique Propagation-Enhanced Content Embedding which is afterward used for classification.

However, much information appearing on the Internet is dubious and even intended to mislead. Some fake news is so similar to the real ones that it is difficult for humans to identify them. Therefore, Fake News Detection (FND) needs to develop effectual models to overcome the existing challenges. So, in this paper, a novel deep-learning approach is developed for the recognition of fake news in pandemic situations. Initially, text data are collected from benchmark resources related to the pandemic situation and provided to the pre-processing stage. Then, the obtained pre-processed data is inputted into the feature extraction process. Here, the features are extracted using glove embedding, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF). Later, the extracted features are taken to the fused optimal weighted feature selection, and the weights are optimized using the Updated Random Variable-based Artificial Rabbits Optimization (URV-ARO), leveraging the Artificial Rabbits Optimization (ARO). The attained optimal weighted features are then given to the classification process. In the classification phase, the fake news is classified with the help of Optimal Attention-based Multiscale Densenet with Long Short-Term Memory layer (OAMDNet-LSTM). Moreover, parameters in DenseNetand LSTM are tuned by developed URV-ARO. Optimizing parameters in the DenseNetand LSTM helps fine-tune the model to achieve higher accuracy in distinguishing between genuine and fake news. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated with conventional approaches to showcase the effectiveness of others. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Bidirectional encoder representation from transformers; Fake news detection; Glove embedding; Optimal attention-based multiscale densenet with long short-term memory layer; Term frequency-inverse document frequency; Updated random variable-based artificial rabbits optimization","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002886589"

In this study, an approach which uses Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) has been taken to detect fake news. The Indian Fake News dataset has been used as a training dataset for the deep learning model. Unlike previous publications, which have focused on a hybrid approach of combining different architectures into a single framework, the BiRNN model was independently used for fake news detection. Additionally, the BiRNN model's performance was compared with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm, which yielded suboptimal results.

Fake or Fake news articles can often change people's minds, destabilize the established democratic movement, and lead to confusion. This project aims to concentrate on the real-time detection of news articles to address the increasing problem of fake news propagation. To formulate this challenge, we employ a range of deep learning models- LSTM, ALBERT, FNNet, and the CNN+RNN model. The accuracy of these models is then compared to see the best architecture for identifying fake news. In textual data, temporal dependencies were captured by the LSTM model with a recorded accuracy of 96.25%. Using ALBERT, which is ideal for NLP tasks got a 100% accuracy pointing to its ability to decipher complex patterns in language. As the architecture of the FNNet is designed to detect fake news, it attained nearly 93% accuracy in its operation. Last but not least, the hybrid CNN+RNN, which combines spatial and temporal feature extraction, achieved 99% accuracy.

However, this information is typically unverified and/or interpreted according to the publisher's point of view. Consequently, malicious users can leverage these unofficial channels to share misleading or false news to manipulate the readers’ opinions and make fake news viral. In this scenario, the early detection of this malicious information is challenging as it requires coping with several issues, which primarily include the scarcity of up-to-date labelled examples and the volume, velocity and variety of news data. To address these issues, we here propose an efficient Semi-Supervised-Learning (SSL) approach to the discovery of a novel temporal ensemble of deep fake-news classifiers. The approach exploits a pseudo-labelling scheme to learn multiple (small-sized pre-trained) BERT-like models in a data- and compute- efficient manner, while effectively curbing the risks of error propagation and confirmation bias that affect standard self-training methods. The results of extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets confirm the ability of the proposed solution to reach a satisfactory balance between classification accuracy and computation efficiency. © 2025 The Author(s)","Deep learning; Ensemble learning; Fake news detection; Pseudo labels; Self-training; Text classification","Article","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216483324"

Due to media’s low cost, ease of use, and quick information transmission, people turn to it for information. However, social media facilitates the widespread dissemination of purposefully misleading information in fake news. Owing to how simple it is to create and distribute information on the internet, the dissemination of false news has recently grown more prevalent. While fake news is not actually true, it is created to appear true for a certain reason. While fake news detection is challenging for humans, deep learning and machine learning methods make the work much simpler. A variety of algorithms for machine learning can make it easier in detecting whether news is true or false. Various researchers utilized classifiers based on machine learning for checking the authenticity of news. It is simple to obtain the datasets needed to train the classifiers.

Recently, there has been an increase in the popularity of using social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc., where everyone can share information very easily. However, malicious users were also increasing on social media, so they shared fake news to mislead the users. Most recently, fake news has spread widely on Twitter. Thus, to solve this problem, this paper proposes an effective deep learning mechanism based on an optimized deep attention (EDLM-ODA) network for detecting fake news on Twitter. First, the input data is converted into a CSV file in JSON format and then pre-processed using tokenization, special character removal, punctuation removal, lowercase, stemming, and spelling correction. The term frequency-inverse average document frequency (TF-IADF), n-gram level vectorizer, character level vectorizer, and hashing vectorizer are feature extractors to extract substantial features. Further, the extracted features are fed into the dual attention based convolutional bi-gated reptile optimal network (DA_CBiG_RepNet) model to classify real and fake news. In the DA_CBiG_RepNet model, the extended reptile optimization algorithm (EROA) is applied to minimize the loss function. The proposed EDLM-ODA network is implemented using the Python platform, and the performance is evaluated in terms of various evaluation metrics using the PHEME, Liar, and FakeNewsNet datasets. Further, the performance of the EDLM-ODA network is compared with prevailing methods. As a result, the implemented outcomes proved that the EDLM-ODA network had attained a better accuracy of 99%, 99.12%, and 99.2% than the prevailing methods using PHEME, Liar, and FakeNewsNet datasets. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Character level vectorizer; Fake news detection; Optimized deep attention network; Pre-processing; Reptile optimizer; Term frequency-inverse average document frequency; Twitter platform; Web information extraction","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001573451"

In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection model that integrates Comment Emotion and User Stance, namely CEUS. Specifically, We first train the emotion recognition task and fake news detection task jointly by multi-task learning, which extracts high-dimensional representations of emotional features from news comments. Then, based on the semantic representations of news content and comments, we calculate their pairwise similarity and take into account the temporal nature of user comments to obtain the forward and backward user stance. Finally, we concatenate emotion features and stance features to detect fake news together. Extensive experiments on real-world fake news datasets Weibo-16 and Weibo-20 show that the CEUS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and learns useful emotion features and stance features to efficiently improve the performance of fake news detection. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.","Deep learning; Emotion recognition; Fake news detection","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210085127"

This phenomenon carries various potential negative effects on society, including the erosion of public confidence in journalists and governmental institutions. Consequently, the identification of fake news has attracted considerable attention from researchers across various fields. As online and social media platforms have grown, it has become easier for false information to mix in with real or verified information. People who spread false information usually have some kind of political or social goal in mind when they spread their hoaxes. Because of this, it is of the utmost importance to come up with a trustworthy way to spot false information. This article describes a way to use deep learning to spot fake news. Methodology is made up of a set of input data. The information in this dataset comes from the social networking site Twitter. First, the raw data that is being used are preprocessed. Stop word removal, stemming, and tokenization are the main parts of data preprocessing. The NTLK library is used to get rid of stop words. Porter’s Algorithm is used to do stemming. N-gram model is used to do tokenization. LSTM, CNN, and AdaBoost algorithms are used to build the model. Results have shown that LSTM is better than CNN and AdaBoost in terms of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. LSTM has achieved an accuracy of 99.24% for fake news detection. Specificity of LSTM is 99.2%. LSTM’s sensitivity is 98.67%. LSTM has achieved an accuracy of 99.24% for fake news detection.

In this study, we systematically evaluate the mathematical foundations and empirical performance of five representative models for automated fake news classification: three classical machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine) and two state-of-the-art deep learning architectures (A Lite Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers—ALBERT and Gated Recurrent Units—GRUs).

However, the widespread dissemination of fake news poses a significant threat to society. Despite the efforts of many research teams to develop automated fake news detection technologies, these methods are often limited to specific domains, such as politics or healthcare. News coverage spans a vast range of fields, each with unique terminology, language style, and themes. In real-world scenarios, news articles are typically assigned a single domain label for classification, even though they often contain content across multiple domains. In this paper, we propose a novel Topic-guided Multi-domain Fake News Detection Framework (TG-MFEND) to address these challenges. TG-MFEND employs an Adaptive View Fusion Module to model news from multiple perspectives, including semantics, style, and themes. Additionally, we designed a Topic Domain Embedder to capture multi-domain features of news. Leveraging these multi-domain features, TG-MFEND adaptively aggregates features from different views to aid in determining news veracity.

This study presents a comprehensive machine learning framework for fake news detection, integrating advanced natural language processing techniques and deep learning architectures. We rigorously evaluate a diverse set of detection models across multiple content types, including social media posts, news articles, and user-generated comments. Our approach systematically compares traditional machine learning classifiers (Naïve Bayes, SVMs, Random Forest) with state-of-the-art deep learning models, such as CNNs, LSTMs, and BERT, while incorporating optimized vectorization techniques, including TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and contextual embeddings. Through extensive experimentation across multiple datasets, our results demonstrate that BERT-based models consistently achieve superior performance, significantly improving detection accuracy in complex misinformation scenarios. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation beyond conventional accuracy metrics by incorporating the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and Receiver Operating Characteristic–Area Under the Curve (ROC–AUC), ensuring a robust and interpretable assessment of model efficacy. Beyond technical advancements, we explore the ethical implications of automated misinformation detection, addressing concerns related to censorship, algorithmic bias, and the trade-off between content moderation and freedom of expression.

Furthermore, existing studies failed to consider the reliability of modalities and their fluctuation across different news. This poses an enormous challenge in attaining trusted multimodal fusion for fake news detection. The lack of uncertainty estimation, which shows the extent such decisions can be trusted, further compounds this issue. Thus, a novel method named trusted multimodal evidential fusion considering behavior information (TMEF-BI) was proposed, including the multimodal data evidence acquisition module, uncertainty estimation module, and trusted multimodal fusion module.

Therefore, this fake news detection is a crucial activity as it contains subtle differences between fake and real news. The major concept of this task is to promote a well-organized and reliable fake news detection method with intelligent technology. The pre-processing was initially performed and then it was subjected to the feature extraction phase. Here, the enhanced optimization algorithm termed as “Probability-based Spider Monkey Optimization (P-SMO)” is used for performing the selection of primary features. The detection of fake or real news is sophisticated by the Optimized Activation Function-based Deep Neural Network (OAF-DNN), in which the P-SMO helps to optimize the activation function to facilitate attaining better detection accuracy and high precision. From the overall evaluation of the results, the accuracy and precision of the offered model attain 98.3% and 98.65%. Experimental analysis of the offered approach is conducted by testing it with the baseline methods based on diverse evaluation metrics. Thus, the developed method outperformed the conventional methods to illustrate its superior performance. The developed fake news detection method can help to ultimately identify and debunk misinformation for generating optimal information, leading to enhanced public trust and decision-making. It has the ability to optimally detect unnecessary details in financial, online misinformation, healthcare, military, and election-related applications. © 2025 by the authors.","Enhanced fake news detection; optimal feature selection; optimized activation function-based deep neural network; probability-based spider monkey optimization; term frequency-inverse document frequency","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006793700"

Building on traditional convolutional neural networks, the model incorporates multi-head attention mechanisms to enhance the extraction of key features from multimodal data such as text, images, and videos. Additionally, residual connections are introduced to deepen the network architecture, mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, and improve the model’s learning depth and stability. Compared with existing approaches, this study introduces several key innovations. First, it constructs a multimodal feature fusion module that integrates text, image, and video data. Second, it designs a cross-modal alignment mechanism to better connect information across different data types. Third, it optimizes the feature fusion structure for more effective integration. Finally, the study employs attention mechanisms to highlight and enhance the representation of salient features. Experiments were conducted using three representative datasets: the LIAR dataset for political short texts, the FakeNewsNet dataset for English multimodal news, and the Weibo dataset from a Chinese social media platform. These were selected to comprehensively evaluate the model’s performance across different scenarios. Baseline models used for comparison include Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Robustly Optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Approach (RoBERTa), Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding (XLNet), Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration (ERNIE), and Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3.5 (GPT-3.5).

Furthermore, simulated experiments were conducted to evaluate the model’s real-world applicability from four dimensions: robustness, generalization ability, response time, and resource consumption. The results demonstrate that the model maintains strong stability and adaptability under data perturbations and diverse input conditions, with a response time controllable within 0.02 s. The model also shows significant computational advantages when handling large-scale datasets. Therefore, this study presents a high-performance and deployment-friendly solution for fake news detection in multimodal contexts.

Experiments show that linguistic similarity significantly influences classification performance. CNN achieves an F1-score of 82% for the Indonesian–Malay pair, a similar language pair. While LSTM achieves 97% for the Indonesian–German language pair (a structurally different language pair).

Nevertheless, the majority of these studies primarily concentrate on either unimodal feature-based methodologies or image-text multimodal fusion techniques, with a minimal focus on the fusion of unstructured text features and structured tabular features. In this study, we present SGAMF, a Sparse Gated Attention-based Multimodal Fusion strategy, designed to amalgamate text features and auxiliary features for the purpose of fake news identification. Compared with traditional multimodal fusion methods, SGAMF can effectively balance accuracy and inference time while selecting the most important features. A novel sparse-gated-attention mechanism has been proposed which instigates a shift in text representation conditioned on auxiliary features, thereby selectively filtering out non-essential features. We have further put forward an enhanced ALBERT for the encoding of text features, capable of balancing efficiency and accuracy. To corroborate our methodology, we have developed a multimodal COVID-19 fake news detection dataset. Comprehensive experimental outcomes on this dataset substantiate that our proposed SGAMF delivers competitive performance in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy and F1 F1 score.  © 2015 IEEE.","fake news detection; multimodal fusion; Sparse gated attention","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001087291"

To overcome these limitations, the present work introduces a methodology consisting of four distinct phases to detect fake news involving data preparation, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification.

This has made it crucial to develop automated systems to detect and combat disinformation. Machine learning and deep learning are often used to identify fake news, but they struggle due to the lack of labeled news datasets. To address this, the One-Class Learning (OCL) approach uses a small set of labeled data. On the other hand, representing data as a graph enables access to diverse content and structural information, and label propagation methods on graphs can be effective in predicting node labels. In this paper, we adopt a graph-based model for data representation and introduce a semi-supervised and one-class approach for fake news detection, called LOSS-GAT. Initially, we employ a two-step label propagation algorithm, utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as an initial classifier to categorize news into two groups: interest (fake) and non-interest (real). Subsequently, we enhance the graph structure using structural augmentation techniques. Ultimately, we predict the final labels for all unlabeled data using a GNN that induces randomness within the local neighborhood of nodes through the aggregation function. We evaluate our proposed method on six common datasets and compare the results against a set of baseline models, including both OCL and binary labeled models. The results demonstrate that LOSS-GAT achieves a significant improvement in performance, with enhancements ranging from 5% (on the FEVER dataset) to 20% (on the FakeNewsNet dataset) in terms of the Macro-F1 metric, all while utilizing only a limited set of labeled fake news data.

To effectively counteract the harmful effects of incorrect information, libraries should be equipped with fast and accurate detection techniques. This paper proposes a deep learning model for effective cessation of false news spread. Initial preparation and cleaning of the dataset are applied to ensure the accuracy of the fed data. Word embedding is a technique used to represent words in the same vector space and apply semantic analysis. To identify false news, this paper chooses two state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and combined Convolutional Neural Network CNN- LSTM. LSTMs have a lengthier term of memory and thus work well with text content, whereas CNNs are designed to extract features from the data. The final CNN-LSTM model combines both algorithms' strengths. Deep learning models are regularized to avoid overfitting. In addition, dropout and early stopping are used. The models' output layer is sigmoid, and the loss function is binary cross-entropy, allowing them to accurately differentiate between fake and authentic news. The results show the effectiveness of the methodology proposed in this paper - the LSTM model achieves 93.79% with dropout and 95.25% with early stopping. The CNN-LSTM model demonstrates superior performance - 96.20% with dropout, 96.11% without early stopping, and 96.20% with early stopping.

In this study, we propose a novel approach, Adapt-BERT (ABERT), for the detection of both human and artificial intelligence (AI)-generated fake news.

This work develops a reliable and understandable method to identify fake news efficiently by combining XAI with ensemble learning and employing different techniques to increase efficacy.

Conventional deep learning methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from the necessity for extensive supervised training and the challenge of adapting to rapidly evolving circumstances. Large language models (LLMs), despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, have fallen short in effectively identifying fake news due to a lack of pertinent demonstrations and the dynamic nature of knowledge. In this paper, a novel framework Multi-Round Collaboration Detection (MRCD) is proposed to address these aforementioned limitations.

Our approach features a two-stage retrieval module that selects relevant and up-to-date demonstrations and knowledge, enhancing in-context learning for better detection of emerging news events. We further design a multi-round learning framework to ensure more reliable detection results. Our framework MRCD achieves SOTA results on two real-world datasets Pheme and Twitter16, with accuracy improvements of 7.4% and 12.8% compared to using only SLMs, which effectively addresses the limitations of current models and improves the detection of emergent fake news detection. © 2025, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

This study aims to optimize the fake news detection model, improve recognition performance and achieve accurate news recommendation. The research methods include data collection and preprocessing, deep learning model design and recommendation strategy formulation. First, false and real news samples are collected from news websites and social media platforms for labeling, cleaning, deduplication and feature extraction. Secondly, a model based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM) is designed. Text features are extracted through TF-IDF and word embedding technology, and a multi-task learning strategy is introduced to optimize fake news detection and content recommendation. The loss function is the weighted sum of classification loss and recommendation loss. In the recommendation strategy, reinforcement learning is used in combination with user feedback to dynamically adjust the recommended content and reduce the spread of misleading information. Experimental results show that the performance of the optimized model is significantly improved: the accuracy is increased by an average of 6.26%, reaching a maximum of 89.7%; the system response time is shortened from 5-6 seconds to 3-4 seconds, an average of 1.9 seconds; the recall rate is increased from 72.8%-79.1% to 85.4%-89.1%, with the maximum increase of 11.6%. The conclusion shows that through data expansion, feature engineering and model optimization, the performance of fake news detection has been significantly improved, and the misjudgment and missed detection rates have been significantly reduced. At the same time, combined with precise recommendation strategies, the user experience has been effectively improved, providing technical support and practical solutions for false information governance. © 2025 The Authors.

The convenience and affordable instant access to data with revolution in mobile technology have directed the production of false news. Fake news has the potential to mobilize public opinion, causing social unrest. Therefore, it is essential to check the authenticity and credibility of news articles being shared on social media. Moreover, versions of fake news are very similar to the actual ones, so it is problematic for humans to recognize them. Therefore, Fake news identification from social media become an Artificial Intelligence (AI) problem. A Cat Swarm Sea Lion Optimization (CSSLnO)-based Deep Quantum Neural Network (DQNN) is developed in this research for detecting fake news. The input is effectively acquired from different websites, such as Twitter and Facebook. Various unique features are extracted from FakeNewsNet and BuzzFeed-Webis Fake News Corpus for the effective fake news detection process. DQNN is applied for identifying fake news using the extracted features. The authors developed an optimization algorithm named CSSLnO and employed it to further train the DQNN model to increase the detection performance. The developed model outperformed the other existing fake news detection techniques with improved accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F-measure of 90.65, 91.90, 89.09, and 91.46%. © Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management 2024.","Cat Swarm Optimization algorithm; Deep Quantum Neural Network; Fake news detection; Nature inspired algorithms; Sea Lion Optimization algorithm; Sentiwordnet features","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197676253"

Multi-domain news refers to handling diverse content across various subject areas such as politics, health, research, crime, and social concerns. Recognizing the lack of systematic research in multi-domain fake news detection, we present a fundamental structure by combining datasets from several news domains. Our two-tiered detection approach, BERTGuard, starts with domain classification, which uses a BERT-based model trained on a combined multi-domain dataset to determine the domain of a given news piece. Following that, domain-specific BERT models evaluate the correctness of news inside each designated domain, assuring precision and reliability tailored to each domain’s unique characteristics. Rigorous testing on previously encountered datasets from critical life areas such as politics, health, research, crime, and society proves the system’s performance and generalizability. For addressing the class imbalance challenges inherent when combining datasets, our study rigorously evaluates the impact on detection accuracy and explores handling alternatives—random oversampling, random upsampling, and class weight adjustment. These criteria provide baselines for comparison, fortifying the detection system against the complexities of imbalanced datasets. © 2024 by the authors.","class imbalance; deep learning; domain classification; fake news","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202344359"

Deep learning processes to detect multimodal fake news have achieved great success. However, these methods easily fuse information from different modality sources, such as concatenation and element-wise product, without considering how each modality affects the other, resulting in low accuracy. This study presents a focused survey on the use of deep learning approaches to detect multimodal visual and textual fake news on various social networks from 201b to 2024. Several relevant factors are discussed, including a) the detection stage, which involves deep learning algorithms, b) methods for analyzing various data types, and c) choosing the best fusion mechanism to combine multiple data sources.

Our study examines how language features, especially Named Entity Recognition (NER) features, play a role in detecting fake news. We built two models: an AraBERT Multi-task Learning (MTL) based one for classifying Arabic fake news, and a token classification model that focuses on fake news NER features. The study combines embedding vectors from these models using an embedding fusion technique and applies machine learning algorithms for fake news detection in Arabic. We also introduced a feature selection algorithm named RLTTAO based on improving the Triangulation Topology Aggregation Optimizer (TTAO) performance using Reinforcement Learning and random opposition-based learning to enhance the performance by selecting relevant features, thereby improving the fusion process.

Despite the existence of many fake news detection models; annotation inconsistency, memory consumption, accurate and self-trained efficient algorithms for detecting the emerging COVID-19 misinformation tweets are still challenging. Hence, the main aim of this work is to come up with a self-trained semi-supervised model that accurately and automatically detects the reliability of emerging COVID-19 tweets without delay. In this work, COVID-19 tweet dataset is created in English Language from the period January 2020 to January 2022 as a ground truth database. Then self-trained semi-supervised hybrid deep learning model is proposed to train both supervised and unsupervised components simultaneously using the created dataset. The proposed model is self-trained repeatedly and the model gets updated to predict the reliability of upcoming COVID-19 tweets that differ from training tweets. We performed experiments multiple times by limiting the percentage amount of labelled tweets shown to the model, namely 80%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20% and 10% labelled tweets, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves 80.92% accuracy and 98.15% accuracy in the 10% and 80% label-seen experiments, respectively. This shows a clear rising trend in the performance curve. Therefore, this technique will be useful for effectively classifying voluminous amounts of emerging tweets generated as part of the COVID-19 infodemic. The proposed model may efficiently use a huge amount of unlabelled tweets and enhance the model's generalization performance. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176758063"

Any transaction ever created in a blockchain is recorded permanently. With the increasing usage of social media modalities today, many non-reputable sources create and publish fake and luring news. Due to the easy availability of the internet and excessive use of social media, fake news can spread like a flash. It causes the need to eliminate fake news posted on social media platforms. The main motive of the paper is to develop an ensemble model that assists in the automated identification of fake news. This paper addresses the identified gaps in detecting multi-modal fake news. We propose Fake News Network (FNNet) as a novel secure blockchain-based deep learning model to detect fake news. It uses blockchain and deep learning to assure data integrity and learn data representations, respectively. The proposed model consists of four layers: the node layer, the deep learning layer, the blockchain layer, and the network layer. This is an ensemble deep-learning model that leverages Bi-LSTM and CNN models, where the Bi-LSTM model captures the sequential data in both directions, and CNN captures the hidden features. We use Pheme, CrisisLexT6, and ISOT datasets to train the model. FNNet achieves an average accuracy of 86.93%, 92.22%, and 98.53% on Pheme, CrisisLexT9, and ISOT datasets, respectively.

COVID-19 after originating from China was in full force and was spreading quickly. This, however, was different from the previous pandemics as this is the age of technology and social circles on the internet. Thus, a sinister form of situation arose where fake news and misinformation flooded social media. The situation got to the point that WHO termed it as an “infodemic”. Thus, NLP was again implored to find a solution and massive research was conducted for the detection of fake news on these platforms. The success of fake news detection improved and by today i.e. in 2023 the techniques have matured quite a bit. Keeping both of these aspects in mind, we have conducted a detailed review on fake news detection techniques for COVID-19. We have discussed the collection of data by providing a deep analysis of 7 COVID-19 Fake News datasets. Moreover, during the analysis of different methodologies, domination of deep learning and hybrid models was observed - specifically ensemble of transformer based models. Additionally, we explored the practical implications of COVID-19 Fake News detectors as components in generative AI models and as browser extensions to keep the common people safe.

Most of the existing multimodal fake news detection methods focus on fully exploiting textual and visual features in news content, thus neglecting the full utilization of news social context features that play an important role in improving fake news detection. To this end, we propose a new fake news detection method based on CLIP contrastive learning and multimodal semantic alignment (SARD). SARD leverages cutting-edge multimodal learning techniques, such as CLIP, and robust cross-modal contrastive learning methods to integrate features of news-oriented heterogeneous information networks (N-HIN) with multi-level textual and visual features into a unified framework for the first time. This framework not only achieves cross-modal alignment between deep textual and visual features but also considers cross-modal associations and semantic alignments across different modalities. Furthermore, SARD enhances fake news detection by aligning semantic features between news content and N-HIN features, an aspect largely overlooked by existing methods. We test and evaluate SARD on three real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SARD significantly outperforms the twelve state-of-the-art competitors in fake news detection, with an average improvement of 2.89% in Mac.F1 score and 2.13% in accuracy compared to the leading baseline models across three datasets. © 2024 The Author(s)","Contrastive learning; Deep learning; Fake news detection; Multimodal learning; Social networks","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202020996"

To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Granularity Enhanced Multimodal High-Order Interaction Network (GMHIN). GMHIN uses a multi-level encoding network to capture detailed and rich semantics and a high-order fusion network with a cross-modal bilinear attention interaction block to effectively fuse images and text. It also employs a feature interaction matrix to ensure consistent representations across modalities. This framework helps identify and mitigate false rumors in multimedia content on social media, thereby reducing misinformation.

Social media platforms such as, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Weibo, and others offer simple access and use. People share posts about their hobbies, entertainment, healthcare, home care, political information, and much more on these sites without fact-checking. After spreading this information, many people followed and propagated it. As a result, many problems are created, and society suffers. So, we need to detect these false or misinformation on social media. This research introduces a novel UcConvoNet model for detecting fake news. Firstly, the model extracts linguistic patterns from the text field of news articles. Next, it generates news article embedding representations, and these feature matrices are then concatenated into one matrix and fed into the proposed deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for fake news classification. The algorithm learns features from news stories based on content and context, which is accomplished by concatenating composite features with CNN. In this work, we have used four real-time datasets of different sizes and one synthetic dataset, “CLUB-Fake,” which is a combination of all four datasets. “CLUB-Fake” resolves the issues of bias and large-scale dataset availability. The proposed model achieved a higher accuracy of 93.44% on McIntire, 99.27% on Kaggle, 99.47% on Reuter, 75.67% on BuzzFeed, and 97.72% on CLUB-Fake datasets than state-of-the-art works. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.","Convolution neural network; Deep learning; Fake news; Machine learning; Misinformation","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009611127"

To address this, developing efficient and intelligent methods for fake news detection is crucial. This paper introduces a dual-stream fusion network model (DSF-MHSA) based on deep learning, designed to detect fake news across web pages, images, and text. The model tackles issues such as cross-lingual discrepancies, data imbalance, and multimodal information fusion by integrating deep learning models like ERNIE-M, AlexNet, and ShuffleNet, along with three multi-head self-attention mechanisms. It processes textual and image data separately to capture long-range dependencies and global information, enhancing understanding and recognition. A unified multi-head self-attention mechanism then merges these insights to strengthen cross-modal correlation detection. The model is tested on datasets from Twitter, Weibo, and IKCEST-2023, which includes real online news from various social media sources. Results show that the DSF-MHSA model achieves over 90 % accuracy, surpassing traditional models in news detection tasks.

While the performance of GPT-X architectures is there for all to see, many efforts are underway to penetrate the secrets of these black-boxes in terms of intelligent information processing whose output statistical distributions resemble that of natural language. In this work, through the complexity science framework, a comparative study of the stochastic processes underlying the texts produced by the English version of GPT-2 with respect to texts produced by human beings, notably novels in English and programming codes, is offered. The investigation, of a methodological nature, consists first of all of an analysis phase in which the Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis and the Recurrence Quantification Analysis - together with Zipf's law and approximate entropy - are adopted to characterize long-term correlations, regularities and recurrences in human and machine-produced texts. Results show several peculiarities and trends in terms of long-range correlations and recurrences in the last case. The synthesis phase, on the other hand, uses the complexity measures to build synthetic text descriptors - hence a suitable text embedding - which serve to constitute the features for feeding a machine learning system designed to operate feature selection through an evolutionary technique. Using multivariate analysis, it is then shown the grouping tendency of the three analyzed text types, allowing to place GTP-2 texts in between natural language texts and computer codes. Similarly, the classification task demonstrates that, given the high accuracy obtained in the automatic discrimination of text classes, the proposed set of complexity measures is highly informative.

This false information has adverse consequences for society and can significantly impact public perception, decision-making, and political outcomes. Therefore, there is an urgent need to build a fake news detection system that can accurately catch false information before it is disseminated. Building such a system requires the existence of good quality and trustworthy labeled datasets. The limitations of the existing datasets are undeniable. Most of them are not updated to reflect the advanced generation patterns of the new fake news creators. Thanks to Truth Seeker research team, who offered a large-scale fake news dataset that was labeled based on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The dataset was collected between 2009 and 2022 and then validated according to a robust procedure to ensure its quality and reliability. However, the credibility and trustability of this dataset is still questionable. In this paper, we study and analyze the feasibility of building a fake news detection model based on deep learning using Truth seeker dataset. Mainly we investigated the impact of different text representation techniques on the accuracy of deep learning models. Also, we investigated the importance of hand-crafted features associated with the dataset in the final results. The results have shown that using truth seeker dataset show potential to help social media platforms in detecting fake news. on the other hand, using deep contextualized text representation produced more accurate results compared to word2vec and TF-IDF techniques. The impact of hand-crafted features on the final performance of deep learning models is often negligible, and it is suggested to be excluded from the final models. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Deep learning; Fake news detection; Machine learning; Text representation; Transformers","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195909787"

However, online platforms like Instagram, Twitter and Facebook get influenced by their users via fake news/reviews. The main intention of spreading fake news is to mislead other network users, which highly affects businesses, political parties, etc. Thus, an effective methodology is needed to predict fake news from social media automatically. The major objective of this proposed study is to identify and classify the given Twitter input data as real or fake through deep learning mechanisms. The proposed study involves four stages: pre-processing, embedded word analysis, feature extraction, and fake news/reviews prediction. Initially, pre-processing is performed to enhance the quality of data with the help of tokenization, stemming and stop word removal. Embedded word analysis is done using Advanced Word2Vec and GloVe modeling to enhance the performance of a proposed prediction model. Then, the hybrid deep learning model named Dense Convolutional assisted Gannet Optimal Bi-directional Network (DC GO BiNet) is introduced for feature extraction and prediction. A Dense Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is hybridized with a bi-directional long-short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) model to extract the essential features and predict fake news from the given input text. Also, the proposed model’s parameters are fine-tuned by adopting a gannet optimization (GO) algorithm. The proposed study used three different datasets and obtained higher classification accuracy as 99.5% in Fake News Detection on Twitter EDA, 99.59% in FakeNewsNet and 99.51% in ISOT.

Classifying FN requires sophisticated approaches to discern nuances, patterns of misinformation, and evolving strategies of disinformation spreaders. Furthermore, contextualizing news texts enables a more in-depth understanding of the nature of the news beyond surface analyses and, thus, more accurate classifications. This study proposes approaches based on Attention-based Deep Multiple Instance Learning (ADMIL) for Fake News Detection (FND), which treats texts through contextual embedding. The proposed approaches leverage the learning capabilities of the MIL model by using an integrated attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on significant instances and dynamically adjusts attention weights. Embeddings provided by state-of-the-art contextual Neural Language Models (cNLMs) such as DeBERTa, SGPT, Flair, and GPT-3.5-based ADA-002 contribute to developing ADMIL-based detection models. These embeddings support the learning process by enabling the model to extract deeper meaning from the data. This study also presents novel approaches that integrate the feature extraction layers of CNNs, called Conv−ADMIL, to improve classification ability by improving extraction resolution. Experimental studies were conducted on two comprehensive FN datasets, LIAR and McIntire, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. In McIntire's dataset, the Conv−ADMIL classifier, utilizing the DeBERTa, achieved an F1−score of 97%, while in the LIAR dataset, employing the ADA-002, it attained a performance of over 93%. These findings demonstrate that integrating the Conv−ADMIL model with DeBERTa and ADA-002 cNLMs yields superior performance across various metrics. As a pioneering research towards new models for this domain, this study lays a foundation for future research and confirms that the proposed approaches are practical for FND tasks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","ADA-002; Attention-based Deep Multiple Instance Learning (ADMIL); Contextualized Neural Language Models; Conv-ADMIL; DeBERTa; Fake news detection","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200243890"

Nevertheless, it is challenging for average people to distinguish fake news from the large amount of information available online, because of the limits on their knowledge, time or space. As a result, it is essential to create automated and auxiliary techniques for early fake news detection. Hence, Fractional Golden Search Dingo Optimisation_Transfer Learning (FGSDO_TL) is proposed. First, the input data is obtained from the review database, and then review vectorisation is carried out by Word2Vec and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for converting the text to numerical vectors. Thereafter, fake news detection is done by applying TL using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which is trained by Fractional Golden Search Dingo Optimisation (FGSDO). Here, FGSDO is developed by integrating the Golden Search Dingo Optimisation (GSDO) with Fractional Calculus (FC). Moreover, the fake word is recognised by identifying the word impact first and then using Deep LSTM (DLSTM). Later, the regeneration of the actual review from the fake review is achieved by using Simple Natural Language Generation (SimpleNLG). The proposed method has achieved 94.36% of sensitivity, 93.94% of specificity and 93.86% of accuracy.  © 2025 World Scientific Publishing Co.","Dingo optimiser; Fake word; Fractional Calculus; transfer learning; Word2Vec","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005278922"

Social media platforms have become significant channels for sharing and exchanging daily news and information on many issues in the current digital environment, which is known for its massive data collection and transmission capabilities. While there are many benefits to this environment, there are also many false reports and information that deceive readers and users into believing they are receiving correct information. Objective: Nowadays, all users use social media to obtain news content, but sometimes some malicious users tamper with real news and then spread fake news, which may reduce the reputation of social media. Therefore, many existing models have been introduced to detect fake news, but these models are based on traditional machine learning algorithms, such as decision tree (DT), multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), etc. These models Lack of performance, security, and authorization. Our proposed model can solve existing model problems using reinforcement learning and blockchain technology. Methods: In this research paper, we explain a new way to identify fake news. This new approach, combined with policy-based heuristic reinforcement learning (PHRL), where the model dynamically adjusts through iterative learning, is the key innovation and gradually improves classification accuracy. The same as our smart contract authorization method, which enhances the authenticity of content posted safely by authorized users and improves the transparency and accountability of information. Results: Our model was tested on real-time information collected from various sources with 70% accuracy and valid authentication. Conclusion: Our proposed model produced better results with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0811 and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.2847, both significantly lower values. Our proposed model performs better than multilayer perceptron (MLP), and random forest (RF). © 2025 Bentham Science Publishers.","authorization; blockchain; fake media; machine learning; natural language processing; Reinforcement learning; security","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000213925"

These have made it possible to have relatively uncharted opportunities for extending one's knowledge base without necessarily having to consult with others or update through physical media. However, access to news across websites, applications, and social media networks has increased equally in tandem and has increased opportunities for producing and sharing fake news. This research focuses on identifying the effect of deep learning models comprising RNN, CNN, and Transformer-based BERT in the fake news detection and classification problem. The dataset used is 76,537 samples, approximately an equal number of real and fake news and mostly in English. This means that CNN training yielded 96.15% accuracy while observing that RNN yielded 95.70%. Additionally, the Transformer-based BERT model performed even better, with an accuracy of 97.44 % better than the two with its bidirectional context comprehension. In order to comprehensively assess the model, such parameters used for evaluation as precision, recall, and F1-score were integrated into the model. This work also investigates the practical scenario of using such models in complex big-data applications and the problems associated with scalability, delay, and resource consumption. With the help of these superior models, this work helps minimize the effects of fake news and raise awareness in the realm of social media and the consumption of news.  © 2025 IEEE.","Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; News; Recurrent Neural Network","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010053581"

Fake news detection (FEND), as a machine learning solution for automatically identifying fake news on Internet, is increasingly gaining the attentions of academic community and researchers. Recently, the mainstream FEND approaches relying on deep learning primarily involves fully supervised fine-tuning paradigms based on pre-trained language models (PLMs), relying on large annotated datasets. In many real scenarios, obtaining high-quality annotated corpora are time-consuming, expertise-required, labor-intensive, and expensive, which presents challenges in obtaining a competitive automatic rumor detection system. Therefore, developing and enhancing FEND towards data-scarce scenarios is becoming increasingly essential. In this work, inspired by the superiority of semi-/self- supervised learning, we propose a novel few-shot rumor detection framework based on semi-supervised adversarial learning and self-supervised contrastive learning, named Detection Yet See Few (DetectYSF). DetectYSF synergizes contrastive self-supervised learning and adversarial semi-supervised learning to achieve accurate and efficient FEND capabilities with limited supervised data. DetectYSF uses Transformer-based PLMs (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) as its backbone and employs a Masked LM-based pseudo prompt learning paradigm for model tuning (prompt-tuning). Specifically, during DetectYSF training, the enhancement measures for DetectYSF are as follows: (1) We design a simple but efficient self-supervised contrastive learning strategy to optimize sentence-level semantic embedding representations obtained from PLMs; (2) We construct a Generation Adversarial Network (GAN), utilizing random noises and negative fake news samples as inputs, and employing Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and an extra independent PLM encoder to generate abundant adversarial embeddings. Then, incorporated with the adversarial embeddings, we utilize semi-supervised adversarial learning to further optimize the output embeddings of DetectYSF during its prompt-tuning procedure. From the news veracity dissemination perspective, we found that the authenticity of the news shared by these collectives tends to remain consistent, either mostly genuine or predominantly fake, a theory we refer to as “news veracity dissemination consistency”. By employing an adjacent sub-graph feature aggregation algorithm, we infuse the authenticity characteristics from neighboring news nodes of the constructed veracity dissemination network during DetectYSF inference. It integrates the external supervisory signals from “news veracity dissemination consistency” to further refine the news authenticity detection results of PLM prompt-tuning, thereby enhancing the accuracy of fake news detection. Furthermore, extensive baseline comparisons and ablated experiments on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of DetectYSF for few-shot fake new detection under low-resource scenarios. © The Author(s) 2024.","Adversarial learning; Contrastive learning; Few-shot fake news detection; LM-based pseudo prompt-tuning; News veracity dissemination consistency","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201832244"

Despite their proficiency in general queries, specialized tasks such as metaphor understanding and fake news detection often require finely tuned models, posing a comparison challenge with specialized Deep Learning (DL). We propose an assessment framework to compare task-specific intelligence with general-purpose LLMs on suicide and depression tendency identification. For this purpose, we trained two DL models on a suicide and depression detection dataset, followed by testing their performance on a test set. Afterward, the same test dataset is used to evaluate the performance of four LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Google Bard, and MS Bing) using four classification metrics. The BERT-based DL model performed the best among all, with a testing accuracy of 94.61%, while GPT-4 was the runner-up with accuracy 92.5%. Results demonstrate that LLMs do not outperform the specialized DL models but are able to achieve comparable performance, making them a decent option for downstream tasks without specialized training.However,LLMs outperformed specialized models on the reduced dataset. © 2015 IEEE.","assessment framework; deep learning; generative artificial intelligence; Large language models","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217059020"

Its role in disseminating news worldwide is significant due to its easy accessibility. However, the increase in the use of these platforms presents severe risks for potentially misleading people. Our research aims to investigate different techniques within machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble learning frameworks in Arabic fake news detection. We integrated FastText word embeddings with various machine learning and deep learning methods. We then leveraged advanced transformer-based models, including BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa, optimizing their performance through careful hyperparameter tuning. The research methodology involves utilizing two Arabic news article datasets, AFND and ARABICFAKETWEETS datasets, categorized into fake and real subsets and applying comprehensive preprocessing techniques to the text data. Four hybrid deep learning models are presented: CNN-LSTM, RNN-CNN, RNN-LSTM, and Bi-GRU-Bi-LSTM. The Bi-GRU-Bi-LSTM model demonstrated superior performance regarding the F1 score, accuracy, and loss metrics. The precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy of the hybrid Bi-GRU-Bi-LSTM model on the AFND Dataset are 0.97, 0.97, 0.98, and 0.98, and on the ARABICFAKETWEETS dataset are 0.98, 0.98, 0.99, and 0.99 respectively. The study’s primary conclusion is that when spotting fake news in Arabic, the Bi-GRU-Bi-LSTM model outperforms other models by a significant margin.

These models may include logistic regression, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), XGBoost, and K-means. Insightful tweet categorization is made possible by determining the ideal number of groups for K-means clustering using the Elbow approach. According to the results of the performance evaluation, K-means outperformed all other methods with regard to accuracy (99.9%), precision (100%), recall (100%), and F1-score (100%).K-means outperforms all other measures, proving that it can accurately differentiate between real and false news tweets. We will address possible dataset biases, investigate ensemble approaches and deep learning architectures to refine our models, and use sentiment analysis to improve the efficacy of false news identification in future endeavors. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.","Clustering; Machine learning; MLP and K-means; Social media; Twitter dataset; XGBoost","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008492387"

Despite the facilities provided by social media, it has also caused a threat to society economically, socially, and politically by publishing fake news that raises political and societal divisions between members of society and each other on the one hand and between members of society and governments on the other. Therefore, in recent years, there has been an active effort to build systems that could distinguish between news types (real and fake). This study provides a text-based technique for identifying fake news. It goes through multiple steps, the first of which is assessing the properties of the incoming text and pre-processing it to clean it of all unimportant words. After that, work is applied to correct the word's spelling before adopting a proposed mechanism to summarize the texts by identifying the essential words and keeping all their repetitions in the resulting summary text to benefit from the most significant possible number of words when passing them to the word merging technology, using the FastText embedding methodology. This is followed by determining the most relevant textual qualities that separate legitimate news from fraudulent news using a suggested deep-learning method consisting of two convolutional layers connected by a self-attention mechanism layer. Before the outcome, the retrieved features are sent into the BiLSTM network, a type of recurrent neural network that is particularly effective in processing and classifying sequential data. The WelFake, ISOT, and TI-CNN datasets were used, and we achieved an accuracy of 90%, 97%, and 89%, respectively. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Attention mechanism; BiLSTM; Word-embedding","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003627382"

Federated learning is the key issue in this research because this kind of learning makes machine learning more secure by training models on decentralized data at decentralized places, for example, at different IoT edges. The data are not transformed between decentralized places, which means that personally identifiable data are not shared. This could increase the security of data from sensors in intelligent houses and medical devices or data from various resources in online spaces. Each station edge could train a model separately on data obtained from its sensors and on data extracted from different sources. Consequently, the models trained on local data on local clients are aggregated at the central ending point. We have designed three different architectures for deep learning as a basis for use within federated learning. The detection models were based on embeddings, CNNs (convolutional neural networks), and LSTM (long short-term memory). The best results were achieved using more LSTM layers (F1 = 0.92). On the other hand, all three architectures achieved similar results. We also analyzed results obtained using federated learning and without it. As a result of the analysis, it was found that the use of federated learning, in which data were decomposed and divided into smaller local datasets, does not significantly reduce the accuracy of the models. © 2024 by the authors.","deep learning; fake news detection; federated learning; natural language processing","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195870031"

Technically, determining fake news on social media platforms is a straightforward binary classification problem. However, manually fact-checking even a small fraction of daily tweets would be nearly impossible due to the sheer volume. To address this challenge, we crawled and crowd-sourced one of the most extensive ground-truth tweet datasets. Utilizing Politifact and expert labeling as a base, it contains more than 180 000 labels from 2009 to 2022, creating five- and three-label classification using Amazon Mechanical Turk. We utilized multiple levels of validation to ensure an accurate ground-truth benchmark dataset. Then, we created and implemented numerous machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including different variations of bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)-based models and classical machine learning algorithms on the data to test the accuracy of real/fake tweet detection with both categories. Then, determining which versions gave us the highest result metrics. Further analysis is performed on the dataset by explicitly utilizing the DBSCAN text clustering algorithm combined with the YAKE keyword creation algorithm to determine topics' clustering and relationships. Finally, we analyzed each user in the dataset, determining their bot score, credibility score, and influence score for a better understanding of what type of Twitter user posts, their influence with each of their tweets, and if there were any underlying patterns to be drawn from each score concerning the truthfulness of the tweet. The experiment's results illustrated profound improvement for models dealing with short-length text in solving a real-life classification problem, such as automatically detecting fake content in social media.  © 2014 IEEE.","Automatic detection; bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) based model training; crowd-sourced data; fake and real ground truth; fake news detection; large feature dataset; twitter dataset; X dataset","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174817107"

Due to the frequency of false content, misinformation has been treated synonymously as fake news. To mitigate the fake news problem, we have explored automatic methods to sort through the vast amount of information for its correctness. The problem occurs because fake news is fabricated deliberately to include false information, which is hard to verify. Many general-purpose classifiers rely on content to determine its reliability which unfortunately often could not be verified due to a lack of information about an incident that happens in real-time. The lack of real-time information inhibits the model’s ability to produce an educated prediction. In our work, we propose a method that focuses on writing style to generalize the classifiers to maintain robust performance for previously unseen topics and unseen sources. The experiment shows that our model could improve over 5% over the BERT [1] model and over 3% over the best results on documents with unknown sources; our model establishes the best results in the condition where training data is insufficient by improving 5-8% over baseline results. © 2024 Institute of Information Science.

First, we introduce the Psycho-Linguistic News Content and Comments (PL-NCC) dataset, a consolidated dataset derived from two prominent fake news datasets, NELA-GT and Fakeddit. Our dataset leverages linguistic and psychological features from both news articles and user comments to enhance the classification accuracy of benchmark models.

However, as research progresses, concerns emerge about the vulnerability of these detection models. In this study, we introduce an attack problem that perturbs user-news engagements by injecting bots to shield the targeted fake news from being detected by GNN-based fake news detection models. We propose a black-box attack method named Query-enhanced Surrogate-based Attack under Assortativity Constraint (QSA-AC) to work for this attack problem. QSA-AC combines surrogate-based and query-based approaches to improve attack effectiveness. At the same time, QSA-AC maintains a balance between attack effectiveness and imperceptibility by adjusting the local fluctuations of the assortativity with respect to the news on the social network. In addition, we introduce an evaluation metric, local strength assortativity perturbation rate (LSAPR), to assess the imperceptibility of the attack from the local perspective. Extensive experiments on two fake news datasets demonstrate that the proposed QSA-AC can achieve the optimal attack effectiveness, and control the trade-off between the attack effectiveness and imperceptibility.  © 2024 ACM.","adversarial attack; fake news detection; social network","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206464089"

This phenomenon became a major concern during the COVID-19 pandemic, where false and fraudulent information spread rapidly, posing a significant threat to public health. The COVID-19 pandemic served as a powerful illustration of this phenomenon, as false and fraudulent health information spread rapidly across online platforms, creating confusion and jeopardizing public health efforts. This highlights the urgent need for solutions to address the spread of fake information, particularly in the area of health, where the consequences of false information can have a direct and potentially devastating impact on individuals and communities. To solve this issue, we propose an ensemble and stacking model that leverages Support Vector Machines (SVM), Arabic Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (AraBERT), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), and Logistic Regression (LR). Our model leverages the strengths of different machine learning techniques to mitigate the spread of harmful false information. To tackle this issue, we use the largest manually annotated Arabic dataset, ArCovidVac, focusing on the COVID-19 vaccination discourse, and we leverage an additional dataset for COVID-19 to generate additional training data for our fake news detection model. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework performs better than previous state-of-the-art approaches.

But creating a reliable method to identify news of this kind is difficult, particularly when the news is released combining factual and fictitious material. The identification of fake news with COVID-19 is challenging task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This study uses Machine Learning (ML) models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Gaussian Naıve Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR) and Deep Learning (DL) models with several architectures such as Long-short Term memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM with one-hot encoding representation and pre-trained word embeddings such as Word2Vec, GloVe and FastText, trained using 14,571 records on DataCOVID19 dataset obtained by combining datasets from three different sources available in Kaggle and GitHub repository. The tests on a real-world COVID-19 news dataset show that Bi-LSTM model improves performance when built over various embedding techniques such as Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText and One-hot encoding representation achieving highest accuracy score.

In the first phase, two new structural features, along with other key features are extracted from news samples.

This research systematically investigates the effectiveness of different word embedding techniques—TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and FastText—when applied to a variety of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models for fake news detection. Leveraging the TruthSeeker dataset, which includes a diverse set of labeled news articles and social media posts spanning over a decade, we evaluated the performance of classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our analysis demonstrates that SVMs using TF-IDF embeddings and CNNs employing TF-IDF embeddings achieve the highest overall performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These results suggest that TF-IDF, with its capacity to highlight discriminative features in text, enhances the performance of models like SVMs, which are adept at handling sparse data representations. Additionally, CNNs benefit from TF-IDF by effectively capturing localized features and patterns within the textual data. In contrast, while Word2Vec and FastText embeddings capture semantic and syntactic nuances, they introduce complexities that may not always benefit traditional ML models like MLPs or SVMs, which could explain their relatively lower performance in some cases. This study emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate embedding techniques based on the model architecture to maximize fake news detection performance. Future research should consider integrating contextual embeddings and exploring hybrid model architectures to further enhance detection capabilities. These findings contribute to the ongoing development of advanced computational tools for combating misinformation. © 2024 by the authors.","deep learning; fake news detection; machine learning; natural language processing; word embedding","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205065185"

Additionally, we incorporate an adaptive-based cyclical learning rate with an early stopping mechanism to enhance model convergence.

Traditional fact-checking struggles with the volume and speed of misinformation, while existing detection systems often focus solely on linguistic features, ignoring factors like source credibility, user interactions, and context. Current automated systems also lack the accuracy to differentiate between genuine and fake news, resulting in high rates of false positives and negatives. This study investigates the creation of a Twitter bot for detecting fake news using deep learning methodologies. The research assessed the performance of BERT, CNN, and Bi-LSTM models, along with an ensemble model combining their strengths. The TruthSeeker dataset was used for training and testing. The ensemble model leverages BERT's contextual understanding, CNN’s feature extraction, and Bi-LSTM’s sequence learning to improve detection accuracy. The Twitter bot integrates this ensemble model via the Twitter API for real-time detection of fake news. Results show the ensemble model significantly outperformed individual models and existing systems, achieving an accuracy of 98.24%, recall of 98.14%, precision of 98.42%, and an F1-score of 98.24%.

While there has been research on identifying news in English, detecting it in Arabic has been relatively overlooked. The unique linguistic characteristics and diverse slang expressions in Arabic have contributed to a scarcity of studies in this area. This research examines the effectiveness of deep learning algorithms in identifying fake news, specifically in the Arabic language. In this study, Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) were used to capture the semantic relationships between words in order to improve the performance of the models. Furthermore, the utilization of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) algorithms has shown potential in the field of neural networks for text classification purposes. The study also delves into incorporating a trained Arabic BERT (Bidirectional Encoded Representations from Transformers) model, which is widely recognized for its outstanding performance, in various natural language processing tasks. The current research utilizes the Arabic Fake News Dataset (AFND). It is a large, fully annotated dataset of Arabic fake news. The results demonstrated that, among all the investigated algorithms, Arabic BERT achieved accuracy with a score of 0.98 on the dataset. According to the results obtained, LSTM and BiLSTM achieved scores of 0.94 and 0.93, respectively, implementing GloVe word embeddings.

This dataset is used for fine-tuning and benchmarking Transformer models like BERT and RoBERTa for fake news detection. Our fine-tuned models showed outstanding performance on this dataset, with accuracy ranging from 97.4% to 98.6%. However, testing with a smaller, independent hand-curated dataset, including statements from political leaders during Spain’s July 2023 electoral debates, revealed a performance drop to 71%.

Fake news stories are problematic not only for the credibility of online journalism, but also due to their detrimental real-world consequences. The primary research objective of this study is to identify recent state-of-the-art deep learning methods used to detect fake news in social networks. This article presents a systematic literature review of deep learning-based fake news detection models in social networks. The methodology followed a rigorous approach, including predefined criteria for study selection of deep learning modalities. This study focuses on the types of deep learning modalities: unimodal (refers to the use of a single model for analysis or modeling purposes) and multimodal models (refers to the integration of multiple models). The results of this review reveal the strengths and weaknesses of modalities approaches, as well as the limitations of low-resource languages datasets. Furthermore, it provides insights into future directions for deep learning models and different fact-checking techniques.

However, this can occasionally lead to the spread of false information. Such information is being disseminated widely, which may cause people to make incorrect decisions about potentially crucial topics. This occurred in 2020, the year of the fatal and extremely contagious Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) outbreak. The spread of false information about COVID-19 on social media has already been labeled as an “infodemic” by the World Health Organization (WHO), causing serious difficulties for governments attempting to control the pandemic. Consequently, it is crucial to have a model for detecting fake news related to COVID-19.

In today's digital society, individuals are often easily influenced by misleading content, making fake news a powerful tool for manipulation. A common strategy employed on social media is the intentional spread of false information with the aim of deceiving and misleading the public. OBJECTIVES: In some cases, this misinformation is so convincing that it significantly influences public opinion and behaviour, with long-term consequences. According to research, only 54% of people are capable of detecting deception without external assistance. To address this growing concern, the proposed model leverages Deep Learning techniques to identify fake news content in both Tamil and English languages. METHODS: The dataset for this study was sourced from an open-access repository on GitHub. After thorough pre-processing, the dataset was divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets. Additionally, the proposed modified attention-based revamping weighted BiLSTM-GRU model is introduced and evaluated. RESULTS: The effectiveness of each model is measured using various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Bilingual Evaluation Understudy, Area under the ROC Curve, and the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. Comparative analysis shows that the proposed model outperforms the existing methods across all evaluation parameters. CONCLUSION: A key advantage of the proposed approach is its capability to accurately detect fake text in both Tamil and English. Furthermore, the model demonstrates strong performance when tested on datasets generated using AI tools like ChatGPT, effectively identifying real and fake content with high precision. © 2025 M.

Researchers have made numerous efforts to build effective models that can automatically identify fake news articles, leveraging advances in natural language processing and machine learning. Approaches using linguistic features and neural networks have shown promise, yet the performance of these methods heavily depends on the availability of large, annotated datasets. While several benchmark datasets for fake news detection exist, particularly for English, there is a notable scarcity of resources for low-resource languages such as Arabic. This study addresses this gap by exploring datasets for fake news detection in Arabic. Our study extends this by surveying a more comprehensive collection of 29 Arabic datasets. It provides an in-depth analysis of available datasets, evaluates their characteristics, and highlights the challenges of fake news detection in Arabic, such as the lack of multimedia data, limited diversity in news domains, insufficient dataset sizes, and the need for comprehensive benchmarks. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts to improve fake news detection in low-resource languages through advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Arabic datasets; Deep learning; Fake news detection; Machine learning; NLP","Review","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210370522"

The detection and prevention of fake news are essential, and previous research has shown that incorporating news content along with its associated headlines and user comments can improve detection performance. However, the semantic relationships between these elements have not been fully explored. This paper proposes a novel approach that models the relationships between news bodies and associated headlines/user comments using deep learning techniques, such as fine-tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and cross-level cross-modality attention sub-networks. In our proposed model, we utilize two different configurations of BERT: pool-based representation, which provides a representation of the entire document, and sequence representation, which represents each token within the document (i.e., at the word and text levels). The approach also encodes user-posting behavioural features and fuses the output of these components to detect fake news using a classification layer. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, highlighting the importance of utilizing semantic relationships for improved fake news detection (FND). These findings have significant implications for combating the spread of fake news and protecting society from its negative effects. © 2024 The Author(s)","Classification; Deep learning; Fake news; Fake news detection; Machine learning; Misinformation; Transfer learning","Article","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202962838"

Fake news is usually written to deceive readers and convince them that this false information is correct; therefore, stopping the spread of this false information becomes a priority of governments and societies. Building fake news detection models for the Arabic language comes with its own set of challenges and limitations. Some of the main limitations include 1) lack of annotated data, 2) dialectal variations where each dialect can vary significantly in terms of vocabulary, grammar, and syntax, 3) morphological complexity with complex word formations and root-and-pattern morphology, 4) semantic ambiguity that make models fail to accurately discern the intent and context of a given piece of information, 5) cultural context and 6) diacrasy. The objective of this paper is twofold: first, we design a large corpus of annotated fake new data for the Arabic language from multiple sources. The corpus is collected from multiple sources to include different dialects and cultures. Second, we build fake detection by building machine learning models as model head over the fine-tuned large language models. These large language models were trained on Arabic language, such as ARBERT, AraBERT, CAMeLBERT, and the popular word embedding technique AraVec. The results showed that the text representations produced by the CAMeLBERT transformer are the most accurate because all models have outstanding evaluation results. We found that using the built deep learning classifiers with the transformer is generally better than classical machine learning classifiers. Finally, we could not find a stable conclusion concerning which model works well with each text representation method because each evaluation measure has a different favored model. © King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals 2024.","AraBERT; Arabic fake news detection; AraELECTRA; ARBERT; BERT; CAMeLBERT; MARBERT; Natural language processing","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191436459"

Now, people can get to know what is going on around the globe with just a click; however, this has also resulted in the issue of fake news. Fake news is content that pretends to be true but is actually false and is disseminated to defraud. Fake news poses a threat to harmony, politics, the economy, and public opinion. As a result, bogus news detection has become an emerging research domain to identify a given piece of text as genuine or fraudulent. In this paper, a new framework called Generative Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (GBERT) is proposed that leverages a combination of Generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and addresses the fake news classification problem. This framework combines the best features of both cutting-edge techniques—BERT's deep contextual understanding and the generative capabilities of GPT—to create a comprehensive representation of a given text. Both GPT and BERT are fine-tuned on two real-world benchmark corpora and have attained 95.30 % accuracy, 95.13 % precision, 97.35 % sensitivity, and a 96.23 % F1 score. The statistical test results indicate the effectiveness of the fine-tuned framework for fake news detection and suggest that it can be a promising approach for eradicating this global issue of fake news in the digital landscape. © 2024 The Authors","Deep learning; Fake news detection; Internet access; Large language model; Social media; Technology; Text classification; Transformers","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200789178"

Its impact spans political, economic, and social domains, fueled by the rapid proliferation of digital communication channels, particularly social media. To combat this menace, researchers have turned to automated mechanisms for detection, leveraging machine learning algorithms and curated datasets. In this exploratory research, the landscape of machine learning algorithms is employed in identifying fake news. Notably, the research focus on algorithms such as the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) respectively. However, most of these studies rely on controlled datasets lacking real-time information from social networks—the very platforms where disinformation thrives. The findings underscore the need for research in social network environments, where fake news spreads most prolifically. Additionally, future investigations should extend beyond political news, considering hybrid methods that combine NLP and deep learning techniques. This study serves as a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers seeking insights into the evolving landscape of the ability to combat fake news effectively. © 2024 Inventive Research Organization.","Deep Learning; Evaluation Metrics; Fake News Detection; Multimodal Datasets; Natural Language Processing; Pre-Trained Embedding; Text Classification","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004698432"

In addition, it has harmful consequences at different levels; individual, community, political, and financial levels. Arabic fake news detection task still needs a considerable amount of effort, due to the lack of datasets and limited research in this field. In this thesis, we investigate detecting the credibility of news in Arabic, based on deep learning methods and transformers models for capturing the hidden information and pattern rather than depending on a set of handcrafted features, that have been addressed in most of the related work in the literature. Also, we release “ArabicFakeNews” which is a manual fake news dataset that contains 2 k Arabic fake news collected from different sources. We also study how the length of news can affect the model performance by applying the deep learning model and transformer-based model on three datasets with different average lengths (title, description, and text dataset). The description dataset performs better in classifying the news, this is due to the fact that the average length of fake news is close to the average length of real news in this dataset. The evaluation result shows that transformers models outperform the deep learning models on the three datasets. The transformer results show that AraBERTv2 on the “description” dataset gets the highest result among all other transformers with an accuracy of 0.97, 0.97 f1-sore, 0.97 precision, and 0.9658 recall. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Arabic language; BiGRU; BiLSTM; Contextualized language representation; Deep learning; Fake news detection; Pre-trained models; Transformers; Word embedding","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191017878"

This misinformation has caused significant confusion among citizens, as well as heightened fear and anxiety. Consequently, it is crucial to develop automatic methods capable of effectively detecting such misinformation. Various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches have been implemented, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Combining multiple approaches has shown promising results. In this study, a hybrid model combining a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and a support vector machine (SVM) was proposed to detect Arabic fake news using the ArCOVID19-Rumors dataset. The MLP was used to extract relevant features, while the SVM was employed to make the final classification decision. The proposed method also leverages Doc2Vec technology, a widely used document embedding technique, to extract features and convert them into numerical vectors while preserving the semantic and syntactic information of the documents. The experiment demonstrated that the hybrid MLP-SVM model outperformed related models when implemented independently. The results showed that the hybrid model achieved an accuracy of 87%, surpassing the performance of standalone MLP (84%) and SVM (83%) models. These results were validated using multiple metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. The study indicates the importance of combining multiple algorithms for detecting fake news, as integrating the strengths of different techniques can lead to significantly improved classification performance. © 2024 Noralhuda Alabid and Hawraa Ali Taher.","Arabic text classification; Doc2Vec embeddings; Fake news detection; Hybrid model; Multi-layer perceptron (MLP); Support vector machine (SVM)","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214711494"

Sentiment analysis methods based on a single data type are becoming increasingly unsuitable. Therefore, MSA has emerged, developed, and become increasingly popular today. MSA plays an important role in many practical applications, particularly in decision-making, recommendation systems, and fake news detection systems. Therefore, new proposals and performance improvements in multimodal sentiment-analysis methods are of great interest to scientists. Many multimodal sentiment-analysis methods have been proposed and developed, including those based on deep learning (DL) models, which have achieved significant prospects. This study comprehensively surveys the aspects related to MSA methods based on deep learning (MSA-based on DL) techniques. MSA-based on DL is the process of identifying sentiment polarities using DL, such as CNN, RNN, LSTM, GAN, and DBN, to create hidden layers for the automation of time-consuming stages, such as feature selection, feature extraction, parameter optimization, feature vector processing, and prediction generation on various data types simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a new taxonomy for MSA methods based on DL, and evaluate and compare method groups using commonly used data types. This article presents the advantages, disadvantages, and challenges that must be addressed in the future. Unlike previous survey works, this study proposes a particular classification by adding a group of multimodal sentiment-analysis methods based on a combination of DL techniques and fuzzy logic. The results of this study are expected to provide essential guidance to beginners, practitioners, and researchers regarding building and improving the performance of multimodal sentiment-analysis methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Fuzzy logic; MSA-based fuzzy deep learning; Multimodal sentiment analysis","Review","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205313411"

Promptly detecting such deceptive content with the help of Machine Learning models is crucial, yet it comes with the challenge of dealing with labelled examples for training these models. Impressive performance results were recently achieved by high-capacity pre-trained transformer-based models (e.g., BERT). Still, such models are too data- and compute-demanding for many critical application contexts where memory, time, and energy consumption must be limited. Here, we propose an innovative semi-supervised method for efficient and effective fake news detection using a content-oriented classifier based on a small-sized BERT embedder. After fine-tuning this model on the sole few labelled data available, an iterative Active Learning (AL) process is carried out, which benefits from limited experts’ feedback to acquire more labelled data for improving the model. The proposed method ensures good detection performances using a few training samples, reasonably small human intervention, and compute/memory costs. © The Author(s) 2024.","Active learning; Deep learning; Fake news detection; Green AI","Article","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191094955"

This research departs from conventional approaches by concentrating not only on the characteristics of shared content but also on user interactions and the resultant topologies of content propagation trees. In our study, we have introduced a deep learning model based on Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN) and enhanced with multi-head attention mechanisms. This model leverages a wide range of psycholinguistic attributes extracted from users’ posts, including sentiment, emotional content, linguistic features, personality traits, readability, and communication style. We further enrich these attributes with BERT embeddings to improve textual representation. Our research framework involves creating two distinct graph networks: the user interaction graph and the semantic propagation graph. These graphical representations are essential for visualizing dynamic interactions and patterns of information dissemination among users. For each user, we generate a set of carefully crafted features that capture their unique characteristics and behaviors. These user-specific features are then integrated into the User Interaction Graph, enabling a more nuanced understanding and representation of user interactions within our proposed model. The proposed framework has demonstrated superior performance on benchmark datasets, achieving accuracies and precisions of 91.07% and 91.24% on the FakeNewsNet dataset, and 94.20% and 94.92% on the FibVid dataset, respectively.

As one of the most important technologies in natural language processing, text classification has a wide range of applications, such as sentiment analysis, news categorization, natural language inference, topic labeling, extractive question answer and fake news detection, etc. From the deepening of traditional machine learning methods to the rising of deep learning methods, related research of text classification models and ideas are constantly evolving, and various new methods, data sets, and evaluation indicators emerge in an endless stream, enriching the research in the field of text classification and achieving excellent theoretical achievements and application effects. Nevertheless, with the rapid development of advanced new technologies, the rich and diverse business application scenarios have also introduced many complex new technical challenges to this field, such as text representation learning with unbalanced data, text classification under few-shot learning scenarios, and so on. In response to the above research challenges and problems, this paper conducts an overall survey of text classification methods, and comprehensively discusses the technical challenges faced by current methods and future research directions. More specifically, this paper mainly consists of seven parts, which are (1) Introducing the relevant basic knowledge of text classification technology, including the definition of common symbols, computational paradigms and text preprocessing techniques, and so on.

The malicious broadcast of illegal, objectionable and misleading content causes behavioural changes and social unrest, impacts economic growth and national security, and threatens users’ safety. The proliferation of AI-generated misleading content has further intensified the current situation. In the previous literature, state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have been implemented for Fake News Detection (FND). However, the existing research lacks multidisciplinary considerations for FND based on theories on FN and OSN users. Theories’ analysis provides insights into effective and automated detection mechanisms for FN, and the intentions and causes behind wide-scale FN propagation. This review evaluates the available datasets, FND techniques, and approaches and their limitations. The novel contribution of this review is the analysis of the FND in linguistics, healthcare, communication, and other related fields. It also summarises the explicable methods for FN dissemination, identification and mitigation. The research identifies that the prediction performance of pre-trained transformer models provides fresh impetus for multilingual (even for resource-constrained languages), multidomain, and multimodal FND. Their limits and prediction capabilities must be harnessed further to combat FN. It is possible by large-sized, multidomain, multimodal, cross-lingual, multilingual, labelled and unlabelled dataset curation and implementation. SOTA Large Language Models (LLMs) are the innovation, and their strengths should be focused on and researched to combat FN, deepfakes, and AI-generated content on OSNs and online sources. The study highlights the significance of human cognitive abilities and the potential of AI in the domain of FND. Finally, we suggest promising future research directions for FND and mitigation. © 2024 by the authors.","dataset evaluation; deep learning; fake news detection; machine learning; natural language processing; social networks","Review","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210553300"

This paper proposes an innovative approach to address such challenges. It introduces a comprehensive framework for detecting fake news, leveraging advanced multimodal techniques to analyze multilingual text and visual data. The proposed framework employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text preprocessing, the DeepL translator for language consistency, and vectorization for feature extraction. For the detection models, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are used for sequential text analysis, while the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model is utilized for image analysis to be performed. The combined features are then processed through a decision-making layer for the news to be classified as real or fake.

The existing literature primarily focuses on analyzing individual features in fake news, overlooking multimodal feature fusion recognition. Compared to single-modal approaches, multimodal fusion allows for a more comprehensive and enriched capture of information from different data modalities (such as text and images), thereby improving the performance and effectiveness of the model. This study proposes a model using multimodal fusion to identify fake news, aiming to curb misinformation. The framework integrates textual and visual information, using early fusion, joint fusion and late fusion strategies to combine them. The proposed framework processes textual and visual information through data cleaning and feature extraction before classification. Fake news classification is accomplished through a model, achieving accuracy of 85% and 90% in the Gossipcop and Fakeddit datasets, with F1-scores of 90% and 88%, showcasing its performance.

Although the pandemic is now under control, information regarding the risks of long-term COVID-19 effects and reinfection still needs to be integrated into COVID-19 policies. Objective: This study aims to develop a robust and generalizable deep learning framework for detecting misinformation related to the prolonged impacts of COVID-19 by integrating pretrained language models (PLMs) with an innovative fuzzy rank-based ensemble approach. Methods: A comprehensive dataset comprising 566 genuine and 2361 fake samples was curated from reliable open sources and processed using advanced techniques. The dataset was randomly split using the scikit-learn package to facilitate both training and evaluation. Deep learning models were trained for 20 epochs on a Tesla T4 for hierarchical attention networks (HANs) and an RTX A5000 (for the other models). To enhance performance, we implemented an ensemble learning strategy that incorporated a reparameterized Gompertz function, which assigned fuzzy ranks based on each model’s prediction confidence for each test case. This method effectively fused outputs from state-of-the-art PLMs such as robustly optimized bidirectional encoder representations from transformers pretraining approach (RoBERTa), decoding-enhanced bidirectional encoder representations from transformers with disentangled attention (DeBERTa), and XLNet. Results: After training on the dataset, various classification methods were evaluated on the test set, including the fuzzy rank-based method and state-of-the-art large language models. Experimental results reveal that language models, particularly XLNet, outperform traditional approaches that combine term frequency–inverse document frequency features with support vector machine or utilize deep models like HAN. The evaluation metrics—including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC)—indicated a clear performance advantage for models that had a larger number of parameters. However, this study also highlights that model architecture, training procedures, and optimization techniques are critical determinants of classification effectiveness. XLNet’s permutation language modeling approach enhances bidirectional context understanding, allowing it to surpass even larger models in the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) series despite having relatively fewer parameters. Notably, the fuzzy rank-based ensemble method, which combines multiple language models, achieved impressive results on the test set, with an accuracy of 93.52%, a precision of 94.65%, an F1-score of 96.03%, and an AUC of 97.15%. Conclusions: The fusion of ensemble learning with PLMs and the Gompertz function, employing fuzzy rank-based methodology, introduces a novel prediction approach with prospects for enhancing accuracy and reliability. Additionally, the experimental results imply that training solely on textual content can yield high prediction accuracy, thereby providing valuable insights into the optimization of fake news detection systems. These findings not only aid in detecting misinformation but also have broader implications for the application of advanced deep learning techniques in public health policy and communication. ©Jian-An Chen, Wu-Chun Chung, Che-Lun Hung, Chun-Ying Wu.","COVID-19; ensemble models; fuzzy ranks; language model; misinformation","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006418301"

The present context has evolved into a widely recognized medium for the distribution of information and news pertaining to a wide range of topics, including daily reports. This timeframe serves as the main period for data collecting and information transmission. This environment has a multitude of advantages; yet, it also entails a significant amount of misinformation and material that may potentially perplex both readers and users seeking accurate information. A significant concern associated with this system is to the limited availability of reliable information and real-world news pertaining to social media. An integrated system has been built that leverages several components of chain type of technology and natural language processing (NLP) to use machine learning techniques for the purpose of detecting false news and enhancing the accuracy of identifying fraudulent user accounts and postings. Various methodologies have been used to extract and choose features in order to provide effective training rules and appropriately assess the test classifier. A comprehensive empirical investigation demonstrates that the Twitter dataset is a useful resource for assessing the precision of fake news detection in classification tasks. The deep learning based RNN system demonstrates a high accuracy rate of 98.80% throughout both training and testing phases. This accuracy surpasses that attained by traditional machine learning methods such as SVM, ANN, and NB. Furthermore, the proposed methodology has the capability to detect superfluous information, a phenomenon that may be corroborated via several sources or by referencing current events. The prime purpose of this approach is to enhance the eminence of the material, identify any problematic sections within the text, and generate the original versions of those sections, all while preserving the original content of the text.

This development has greatly impacted virtual communities for the ease and speed of communication and information transfer through social media platforms, making these platforms likable and easy to use. The social network faces major challenges due to its extensive use. As a result, many people have become involved in cybercrimes. There are accounts on the internet that are malicious. Platforms for social networking online, such as Facebook and Twitter, allow all users to freely generate and consume massive volumes of material regardless of their traits. While individuals and businesses utilize this information to gain a competitive edge, spam or phony users create important data. According to estimates, 1 in 200 posts on social media contain spam, and 1 in 21 tweets contain spam. The problem was centered around the accuracy of detecting false news and correcting it or preventing its dissemination before it spread in the network. A new method is given based on improving the false news detection system; the level of improvement was significant in the preprocessing stage where Glove is used, which is an unsupervised learning algorithm developed by researchers at Stanford University aiming to generate word embeddings by aggregating global word co-occurrence matrices from a given corpus. The basic idea behind the GloVe word embedding is to derive the relationship between the words from statistics. The proposed method contains deep learning algorithms of convolutional neural network (CNN), deep neural network (DNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM).

These methods enable us to identify multiple semantic dissimilarity characteristics, resulting in a more thorough examination. The obtained distance values are combined and used as features in our fake news detection models. These composite features are used to train various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models across three distinct news article datasets. Our approach achieves an accuracy rate of nearly 99.9%.

Conventional methods generally focus on capturing the linguistic and visual semantics within the multimodal content, which fall short in effectively distinguishing the heightened level of meticulous fabrications. Recently, external knowledge is introduced to provide valuable background facts as complementary to facilitate news detection. Nevertheless, existing knowledge-enhanced endeavors directly incorporate all knowledge contexts through static entity embeddings, resulting in the potential noisy and content-irrelevant knowledge. Moreover, the integration of knowledge entities makes it intractable to model the sophisticated correlations between multimodal semantics and knowledge entities. In light of these limitations, we propose a novel Adaptive Knowledge-Aware Fake News Detection model, dubbed AKA-Fake. For each news, AKA-Fake learns a compact knowledge subgraph under a reinforcement learning paradigm, which consists of a subset of entities and contextual neighbors in the knowledge graph, restoring the most informative knowledge facts. A novel heterogeneous graph learning module is further proposed to capture the reliable cross-modality correlations via topology refinement and modality-attentive pooling. Our proposal is extensively evaluated over three popular datasets, and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of AKA-Fake.

Most of these forms of fake news have been detected using multimodal feature fusion, with less attention being paid to the correlation between two modalities and the interaction within and between individual modalities. To address this problem, we propose a multimodal mechanism based on CLIP for fake news detection, referred to as CLIP-FND. First, the visual encoder and text encoder of the large-scale graphical pre-Training model CLIP are used to unify and map the image and text data into the same feature space respectively. Then, the attention mechanism and the bilinear pooling method are used to fuse the text feature vector and the visual feature vector and input to the fake news detector for fake news detection. The experimental results show that the accuracy and F1 value of the model are much higher than the traditional multimodal fake news detection model on the publicly available dataset, which improves the fake news detection effect. © 2024 ACM.","CLIP model; Deep learning; Fake news detection; Multimodal","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200221967"

The dissemination of fake information can lead to social harm and damage the credibility of information. To address this issue, deep learning has emerged as a promising approach, especially with the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This study introduces a novel approach called Graph Global Attention Network with Memory (GANM) for detecting fake news. This approach leverages NLP techniques to encode nodes with news context and user content. It employs three graph convolutional networks to extract informative features from the news propagation network and aggregates endogenous and exogenous user information. This methodology aims to address the challenge of identifying fake news within the context of social media. Innovatively, the GANM combines two strategies. First, a novel global attention mechanism with memory is employed in the GANM to learn the structural homogeneity of news propagation networks, which is the attention mechanism of a single graph with a history of all graphs. Second, we design a module for partial key information learning aggregation to emphasize the acquisition of partial key information in the graph and merge node-level embeddings with graph-level embeddings into fine-grained joint information.

However, in the absence of strict regulations mandating the genuineness of every text on social media, it is probable that some of these texts are fake news or rumors. Their deceptive nature and ability to propagate instantly can have an adverse effect on society. This necessitates the need for more effective detection of fake news and rumors on the web. In this work, we annotate four fake news detection (EFN) and rumor detection datasets with their emotion class labels using transfer learning. We show the correlation between the legitimacy of a text with its intrinsic emotion for fake news and rumor detection, and prove that even within the same emotion class, fake and real news are often represented differently, which can be used for improved feature extraction. Based on this, we propose a multitask framework for fake news and rumor detection, predicting both the emotion and legitimacy of the text. We train a variety of deep learning models in single-task (STL) and multitask settings for a more comprehensive comparison. We further analyze the performance of our multitask approach for EFN in cross-domain settings to verify its efficacy for better generalization across datasets, and to verify that emotions act as a domain-independent feature.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have been widely applied in the field of fake news detection, and the use of NLP technology to detect fake news has become a hot research topic both domestically and internationally. With the advancement of image editing and image generation technologies, fake images are increasingly flooding internet news, making the detection of fake news based on solely textual modality more challenging. This has made multimodal fake news detection increasingly important. Existing multimodal fake news detection faces two issues: the inability to effectively fuse features from image and text modalities, and the inability to enable models to learn the consistency and differences within and between modalities to detect false information. To address these issues, cross-attention mechanisms and contrastive learning have been introduced into multimodal fake news detection, enhancing the fusion of multimodal features and the effectiveness of fake news detection. Firstly, the cross-attention mechanism is used to deeply model information from different modalities, achieving efficient fusion of multimodal information. In addition, two new methods for constructing positive and negative examples in multimodal fake news detection were proposed, using contrastive learning to semantically align images and text. Experiments show that the proposed model improved by 5.9%, 4.4%, and 1.6% respectively on three real-world datasets compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, and the effectiveness of each proposed module was verified through ablation studies. © 2024 IEEE.","component; Deep Learning; Fake News Detection; Multimodal; Pretrained Models","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199140605"

This work proposes an attentive fusion framework for detecting multimodal fake news. Our approach employs ResNet50 to extract visual features and BERT for textual representations, followed by an attention layer to integrate the modality-specific features for fake news detection.

False news spreads among people, misleads individuals and causes great harm in politics, economy, public health, and other fields. Despite the challenges of fake news detection and intervention, excellent technical support is provided in this regard thanks to recent advances in big data, natural language processing (NLP), deep learning paradigms, and more. Currently, however, the technology that can be used to determine whether news is true or false has been developed primarily in English - and there is an urgent need to optimize doing this in China at a non-minimal scale and complexity. The motivation and purpose of this study is to achieve the same high accuracy of fake news detection in the Chinese context. This article suggests a high-precision Chinese fake news detection system that innovatively combines the ERNIE 3.0, TextCNN, and BiLSTM models. Each model has a distinct role in our system: ERNIE 3.0 collects sophisticated semantic information using its robust pre-trained language model, which is particularly useful for comprehending Chinese text; TextCNN is good at extracting local features from text and identifying essential patterns. BiLSTM excels in identifying long-distance dependencies and contextual information in text. We employ a progressive training technique, initially training and optimizing the performance of each model independently, and then in the integrated model by weighting the outputs of these independent models so that they learn from one another, hence enhancing overall predictive power. As a result, our model can effectively integrate the benefits of each, improve the complete analysis capability of the complex characteristics of fake news, and increase robustness. It is worth noting that our ECL model (Ernie-TextCNN-BILSTM integration) achieved an accuracy of 0.7608 in the Chinese fake news identification assignment, outperforming typical machine learning methods. This will be an important step in contributing to research in the broader field of information verification and fake news detection while paving the way for future work across other languages and other areas. © 2024 IEEE.","BiLSTM; Chinese language processing; Deep Learning; ERNIE 3.0; fake news detection; GloVe; NLP; sentiment analysis; TextCNN","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215606676"

An unverified news is often disseminated through text and images. Before sharing the news with the public sector, it is crucial to confirm it. Earlier, unimodal fake news detection (FND) techniques are not much effective at detecting false news as they extract and classify textual and visual features separately. In order to identify false news, multimodal fake news detection models have been proposed. These models use textual and visual data to identify fake news. The textual features are extracted using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, which keeps the semantic links between words. The Capsule Neural Network (CapsNet) derives extremely informative visual feature from an image. Utilizing these attributes produces a richer data representation that makes it simpler to determine if the news is authentic or false. The most of the model only examines dataset of fake news in english to determine if it is true or fake, but CB-Fake approach is expanded to incorporate datasets of fake news in other widely used languages, such as Tamil.

Fake news encompasses intentionally falsified information designed to mislead readers and manipulate public perception, resulting in low-quality and misleading content. This paper presents a machine learning-based approach for fake news detection using: 1) Sentiment knowledge to calculate a sentence sentiment score as one of the features for sentence-level classification. 2) Statistical and linguistic knowledge to extract required features. The proposed method combines several types of features into a unified feature set to design a more accurate classification system (“True”: the fake news; “False”: otherwise). Thus, to achieve better performance scores, we carried out a performance study of five well-known feature selection techniques and several most famous classifiers to select the most relevant set of features and find an efficient Machine Learning (ML) classifier, respectively. Alongside traditional machine learning models, we also applied different Deep Learning (DL)-based models. Different machine learning and deep learning-based methods are applied to three different datasets including Liar, GossipCop, and PolitiFact, and the results show the integration of machine learning-based classification method and feature selection technique can significantly improve the performance and make the method comparable to other existing methods. Furthermore, DL models, in particular LSTM, exhibited remarkable accuracy thresholds of up to 88% in capturing intricate patterns within textual data. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Deep learning; Fake news detection; Machine learning","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185708442"

To address this gap, we propose the RoBERTa-based fake news detection model with hybrid features - RAFAH. First, we extract a hybrid feature set (emotional, linguistic, psycholinguistic, and readability) from the datasets.

From the model structure, existing research works can be categorized into three types: convolution filtering-based neural network approaches, sequential analysis-based neural network approaches, and attention mechanism-based neural network approaches. However, almost all of them were developed oriented to scenes of a single language, without considering the context of mixed languages. To bridge such gap, this article extends to the basic pretraining language processing model transformer into the multiscale format and proposes a novel fake news detection model for the context of mixed languages through a multiscale transformer to fully capture the semantic information of the text. By extracting more fruitful feature levels of initial textual contents, it is expected to obtain more resilient feature spaces for the semantics characteristics of mixed languages. Finally, experiments are conducted on a postprocessed real-world dataset to illustrate the efficiency of the proposal by comparing performance with four baseline methods. The results obtained show that the proposed method has an accuracy of about 2%-10% higher than commonly used baseline models, indicating that the scheme has appropriate detection efficiency in mixed language scenarios.  © 2014 IEEE.","Deep learning; fake news detection; mixed semantic analysis; multiscale transformer","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168752361"

Fake news detection on social media has recently become an emerging research area that is attracting tremendous attention. Existing studies have proposed to employ traditional machine learning (ML) or emergent deep learning (DL) methods to detect fake news. These ML or DL methods based on batch processing and learning from a training dataset, however, are inefficient in conducting continual real-time fake news detection for incoming unseen social media data. In this research, we propose to use online machine learning (OML) to automatically identify fake news in real time. We investigated various online learning algorithms, including Approximate Large Margin Algorithm (ALMA), Passive-Aggressive (PA), etc., and compared their performance with some existing ML or DL methods for real-time fake news detection on Twitter. The preliminary results of our study demonstrate the considerable potential of OML techniques in classifying real-time fake news, thus highlighting the adaptability and robustness of OML in handling dynamic information streams such as fake news. © 2024 30th Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2024.

However, with the exponential growth of social media platforms, there has been a significant shift towards visual content. Consequently, traditional detection methods have become inadequate for completely detecting fake news. This paper proposes a model for detecting fake news using multi-modal features. The model involves feature extraction, feature fusion, dimension reduction, and classification as its main processes. To extract various textual features, a pre-trained BERT, gated recurrent unit (GRU), and convolutional neural network (CNN) are utilized. For extracting image features, ResNet-CBAM is used, followed by the fusion of multi-type features. The dimensionality of fused features is reduced using an auto-encoder, and the FLN classifier is then applied to the encoded features to detect instances of fake news. Experimental findings on two multi-modal datasets, Weibo and Fakeddit, demonstrate that the proposed model effectively detects fake news from multi-modal data, achieving 88% accuracy with Weibo and 98% accuracy with Fakeddit. This shows that the proposed model is preferable to previous works and more effective with the large dataset.  © 2013 IEEE.","auto-encoder; deep learning; dimensionality reduction; fake news detection; fusion; multi-model features; Social media platforms","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196064083"

Due to the large amount of information and news produced daily in text, audio, and video, the validation and verification of this information have become crucial tasks. Leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence, distinguishing between fake news and factual information through automatic fake news detection systems has become more feasible. Automatic fake news detection has been explored from diverse perspectives, employing various feature extraction and classification models. Nonetheless, empirical evaluations, categorization, and comparisons of existing techniques for handling this problem remain limited. In this paper, we revisit the definitions and perspectives of fake news and propose an updated taxonomy for the field based on multiple criteria: (1) Type of features used in fake news detection; (2) Fake news detection perspectives; (3) Feature representation methods; and (4) Classification approaches. Moreover, we conduct an extensive empirical study to evaluate several feature representation techniques and classification approaches based on accuracy and computational cost. Our experimental results demonstrate that the optimal feature extraction techniques vary depending on the characteristics of the dataset. Notably, context-dependent models based on transformer models consistently exhibit superior performance. Additionally, employing transformer models as feature extraction methods, rather than solely fine-tuning the network for the downstream task, improves overall performance. Through extensive error analysis, we identify that a combination of feature representation methods and classification algorithms, including classical ones, offer complementary aspects and should be considered for achieving better generalization performance while maintaining a relatively low computational cost.

Traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models, i.e., Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have been employed to address Fake News Detection (FND) with varying degrees of success. However, these models often struggle with data dependency, overfitting, scalability, flexibility, and high computational costs. A Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) approach is proposed for Fake News Detection (ZS-FND) to address these challenges. ZSL models can predict outcomes with limited training data and do not rely on domain-specific labeled data, making them well-suited for handling fake news's diverse and evolving nature. The proposed ZS-FND model leverages the pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for the semantic representation of textual data and generates word vectors. ZSL considers such vectors as input for FND. The experimental results demonstrate that ZS-FND outperforms conventional ML and DL models, achieving 98.39% accuracy, 97.33% precision, 95.67% recall, 96.49% F1-score, and 0.0160 Mean Absolute Error (MAE). ZS-FND improves accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score by 10.76%, 4.05%, 5.96%, and 5.01%, respectively.

To address this issue, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have been proposed as effective solutions. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of transformer-based models, particularly BERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa, alongside ensemble learning techniques, to enhance the performance of fake news detection tasks. Specifically, we fine-Tuned these pre-Trained models on two widely used datasets: LIAR and ISOT, which represent different levels of complexity in fake news classification. Subsequently, our approach integrates individual transformer models with ensembling methods such as Majority vote, Averaging and Highest-sum, significantly improving classification accuracy.

Thus, detecting false or misleading information from the plethora of information is a substantial task. Using the Evolutionary Algorithm and an ensemble deep learning model over the dataset Gossipcop, we have used a hybrid model for the classification of real and fake news.

This study proposes a novel approach for fake news detection using a Bi-LSTM neural network with an attention mechanism. The Bi-LSTM model's ability to discern long-range relationships and sequential patterns in text data is augmented by the attention mechanism, focusing on key segments within the text to enhance discriminative power. The dataset for training comprises a diverse collection of news articles, meticulously annotated by human fact-checkers to include both real and fake news samples. Pre-processing steps, including tokenization, are undertaken to optimize the model's learning capabilities. The proposed Self-Attention with Bi-Directionals-LSTM (SA-BiLSTM) model demonstrates promising performance in distinguishing real from fake news. The attention mechanism allows the model to highlight critical words and phrases, capturing essential features for accurate predictions. Evaluation through cross-validation reveals competitive results as opposed to cutting-edge fake news identification methods. Ablation studies emphasize the attention mechanism's significant contribution to identifying relevant textual patterns associated with fake news. The model, incorporating CNN, GRU, Attention-GRU, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM, surpasses contemporary procedures, as validated using the ISOT dataset. The results demonstrate a robust approach to fake news detection using Bi-LSTM with attention, contributing to the fight against misinformation. The proposed model SA-Bi LSTM obtained 99.98% predictive accuracy on test data. The accuracy of the proposed model (SA-BiLSTM) comparatively to baseline models is higher. The model shows potential for preserving information integrity on social media and news outlets, bolstering public trust in reliable sources. © 2013 IEEE.","bid-LSTM; Fake news detection; ISOT dataset; long short-term memory (LSTM); SA-BiLSTM; self-attention mechanism","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189647266"

AraELECTRA emerged as the most effective model in this task. Leveraging this model, we then implemented a multitask learning approach to detect both fake information and tweets discussing treatments or vaccines.

Existing solutions focus on supervised fake news detection models, which requires extensive labelled data. In this paper, we deal with two different problems of fake news detection such as (1) Detecting fake news with limited annotated data and (2) Interpretability of the proposed model on fake news detection. We address these issues by designing an Interpretable Self Ensembled Semi-Supervised Fake News Detection Model (I-S2FND). In I-S2FND, the model learns the enhanced representations of labelled and unlabelled fake news by incorporating an adaptive pseudo-labelling mechanism on unlabelled data. Moreover, interpretation of the model on text using the gradients improves the identification of essential words in the content of fake news. Based on the experimental findings, it is evident that the proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models by approximately 5% in terms of accuracy when trained with only a limited amount of labeled data across different datasets. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.","Deep learning; Fake news; Semi-supervised; Social media; Text classification; Transformers","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174405826"

Manual fact verification is a frequently utilized strategy for mitigating the harmful impacts of false news transmission. However, when assessing the massive volume of freshly produced material, manual fact verification is insufficient. Furthermore, the quantity of labeled datasets is limited, people are unreliable annotators, resources are largely in the English language, and they mostly concentrate on articles related to news. Cutting-edge deep learning algorithms are employed to deal with this challenge automatically and address these difficulties. Nevertheless, the large number of models and variability of characteristics utilized in the literature frequently constitute a barrier for researchers attempting to enhance the effectiveness of models. This paper introduces a model designed to address the issue of false news, with a focus on analyzing news headlines. The approach is rooted in a hybrid classification model where our model integrates a BERT architecture, and the outputs are seamlessly linked to bi-directional deep learning layers, including a bi-LSTM layer and a bi-GRU layer. The model's training and evaluation were conducted using the WELFake dataset, comprising four prevalent news databases. A comparative analysis was carried out using the proposed model and standard classification models. Additionally, standard machine learning and deep learning models along with vanilla BERT were trained on the same dataset with comparable constraints to assess the impact of integrating a bi-directional deep learning layer with BERT. The results revealed an improvement in accuracy, as our proposed model achieved an accuracy of 98.1% and an F1 score of 0.982. © 2013 IEEE.","Bi-directional deep learning; fake news detection; transformers","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207357573"

This disrupts various news sources such as online news outlets, radio and television stations, and newspapers, especially in Arab countries. Therefore, the fake news detection problem has been raised worldwide. Arabic research in this field is very little compared to English research. Previous researchers had used machine learning and deep learning techniques on a large scale, but recently they used pre-trained models in their studies. Our proposed model works by using the Arabic pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (Arabic BERT) to extract features from the text, then uses a Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN or 2D-CNN) to reduce the size of the features and extract the important ones, then passes it to an artificial neural network to perform the classification process. In our experiment we introduce a novel hybrid system consists of two main parts. In the first part we try three Arabic pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers model (APBTM) which are AraBERT, GigaBERT or MARBERT, while in the second part, we use 1D-CNN or 2D-CNN. this leads to six architectures from this system. we make our experiment by train and evaluating every architecture using three datasets which are (Arabic News Stance (ANS), AraNews, and Covid19Fakes). A comparison is made between the proposed model and other modern models which used the same dataset. We made three sets of experiments depending on the used datasets. Each set includes a group of experiments, and then we present the results in tables. Our proposed model which is the hybrid model between AraBERT and 2D-CNN has achieved the best F1-scores of 0.6188,0.7837 and 0.8009 when using the ANS dataset, the Ara-News dataset, and the Covid19Fakes dataset respectively. Furthermore, the model reduces the training time by achieving better results with less number of epochs. The results indicate that the proposed model offers the best performance, with 71% accuracy in the Arabic News Stance (ANS) dataset outperforming the model made by Sorour and Abdelkader (2022) and the model made by Shishah (2022) that achieved accuracy of 67% and 66% respectively.  © 2013 IEEE.","BERT; CNN; deep learning; fake news detection; machine learning","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202749476"

There has been a wide variety of countermeasures developed to offset the effect and propagation of Fake News. The most common are linguistic-based techniques, which mostly use deep learning (DL) and natural language processing (NLP). Even government-sponsored organizations spread fake news as a cyberwar strategy. In literature, computational-based detection of fake news has been investigated to minimize it. The initial results of these studies are good but not significant. However, we argue that the explainability of such detection, particularly why a certain news item is detected as fake, is a vital missing element of the studies. In real-world settings, the explainability of the system's decisions is just as important as its accuracy. This article explores explainable fake news detection and proposes a sentence-comment-based co-attention sub-network model. The proposed model uses user comments and news contents to mutually apprehend top-k explainable check-worthy user comments and sentences for detecting fake news. The experimental result on real-world datasets shows that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by 5.56% in the F1 score. In addition, our model outperforms other baselines by 16.4% in normalized cumulative gain (NDCG) and 22.1% in Precision in identifying top-k comments from users, which indicates why a news article can be fake. © 2014 IEEE.","Attention; deep learning (DL); fake news detection; long short-term memory (LSTM)","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202004637"

The restrictions imposed by censors make the objective reporting of news difficult. Most studies use supervised methods, relying on a large amount of labeled data for fake news detection, which hinders the effectiveness of the detection. Meanwhile, the focus of these studies is on the detection of fake news in a single modality, either text or images, but actual fake news is more often in the form of text–image pairs. In this paper, we introduce a self-supervised model grounded in contrastive learning. This model facilitates simultaneous feature extraction for both text and images by employing dot product graphic matching. Through contrastive learning, it augments the extraction capability of image features, leading to a robust visual feature extraction ability with reduced training data requirements. The model’s effectiveness was assessed against the baseline using the COSMOS fake news dataset. The experiments reveal that, when detecting fake news with mismatched text–image pairs, only approximately 3% of the data are used for training. The model achieves an accuracy of 80%, equivalent to 95% of the original model’s performance using full-size data for training. Notably, replacing the text encoding layer enhances experimental stability, providing a substantial advantage over the original model, specifically on the COSMOS dataset. © 2024 by the authors.","contrastive learning; deep learning; few-shot learning; misinformation detection","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186439600"

With the rise of media-rich social media platforms, fake news has evolved from single-text to multimodal formats, prompting increased attention to multi-modal fake news detection. However, most existing methods rely on representation-level features that are closely tied to the dataset, resulting in insufficient modelling of semantic-level features and a limited ability to generalize to new data. To address this issue, we propose a semantically enhanced multimodal fake news detection method that utilizes pre-trained language models to capture implicit factual knowledge and explicitly extracts visual entities to better understand the deep semantics of multimodal news. We also extract visible features at different semantic levels, use a text-guided attention mechanism to model semantic interactions between text and images, and integrate multimodal features. Experimental results on real datasets based on Weibo news demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other methods with an accuracy of 0.895 in multimodal fake news detection. © (2024), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society).

Although deep learning methods like CNNs, RNNs, and Transformer-based models like BERT have enhanced fake news detection. However, they primarily focus on content and do not consider social context during news propagation. Graph-based techniques have incorporated the social context but are limited by the need for large labeled datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces GAMC, an unsupervised fake news detection technique using the Graph Autoencoder with Masking and Contrastive learning. By leveraging both the context and content of news propagation as self-supervised signals, our method reduces the dependency on labeled datasets. Specifically, GAMC begins by applying data augmentation to the original news propagation graphs. Subsequently, these augmented graphs are encoded using a graph encoder and subsequently reconstructed via a graph decoder. Finally, a composite loss function that encompasses both reconstruction error and contrastive loss is designed. Firstly, it ensures the model can effectively capture the latent features, based on minimizing the discrepancy between reconstructed and original graph representations. Secondly, it aligns the representations of augmented graphs that originate from the same source. Experiments on the real-world dataset validate the effectiveness of our method.

As the volume of information grows, individuals increasingly struggle to discern credible content from false narratives, leading to widespread misinformation and potentially harmful consequences. Despite numerous methodologies proposed for fake news detection, including knowledge-based, language-based, and machine-learning approaches, their efficacy often diminishes when confronted with high-dimensional datasets and data riddled with noise or inconsistencies. Our study addresses this challenge by evaluating the synergistic benefits of combining feature extraction and feature selection techniques in fake news detection. We employ multiple feature extraction methods, including Count Vectorizer, Bag of Words, Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe), Word to Vector (Word2Vec), and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), alongside feature selection techniques such as Information Gain, Chi-Square, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Document Frequency. This comprehensive approach enhances the model’s ability to identify and analyze relevant features, leading to more accurate and effective fake news detection. Our findings highlight the importance of a multi-faceted approach, offering a significant improvement in model accuracy and reliability. Moreover, the study emphasizes the adaptability of the proposed ensemble model across diverse datasets, reinforcing its potential for broader application in real-world scenarios. We introduce a pioneering ensemble technique that leverages both machine-learning and deep-learning classifiers. To identify the optimal ensemble configuration, we systematically tested various combinations. Experimental evaluations conducted on three diverse datasets related to fake news demonstrate the exceptional performance of our proposed ensemble model. Achieving remarkable accuracy levels of 97%, 99%, and 98% on Dataset 1, Dataset 2, and Dataset 3, respectively, our approach showcases robustness and effectiveness in discerning fake news amidst the complexities of contemporary information landscapes. This research contributes to the advancement of fake news detection methodologies and underscores the significance of integrating feature extraction and feature selection strategies for enhanced performance, especially in the context of intricate, high-dimensional datasets.

Unconfirmed news is frequently spread in multimedia content form such as video, audio, picture, or text. The propagation of certain false news cheats the public results in protests and generates issues. Fake news propagation has become a significant issue in modern data because of the huge utilization of social media entities. One of the important operations is false news identification, yet the difficulty of some languages makes the identification of fake news complex. The conventional approaches cannot gather many contextual and semantic features from the documents in a specific multilingual text corpus. To overcome such issues, a residual-based deep learning model is introduced for fake news detection using multimodal information. Firstly, multimodal information like text and images are gathered from publicly available data sources. Further, the input text is undergone for pre-processing and it is used for extracting the features. Here, the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is employed as feature extraction as F1. Similarly, the features from the raw image are achieved by applying the Visual Geometry Group (VGG16), designated as F2. Finally, these two resultant features are concatenated together and subjected to the Residual Recurrent Neural Network (Res-RNN) for detecting fake news. Hence, the proposed system is examined with different metrics and compared with various approaches. Thus, the results declare that the suggested system achieves higher accuracy in avoiding the spreading of fake news over the media. © 2024 IEEE.","Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer; Feature Integration; Multimodal Fake News Detection; Residual Recurrent Neural Network; Visual Geometry Group16","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213404867"

However, this technological development has also inadvertently facilitated the creation and widespread dissemination of misinformation. Prior research has concentrated on addressing grammatical issues, inflammatory content, and other pertinent features by employing deep learning models to characterize and model deceptive elements within fake news content. These approaches not only are lack of the capability to assess the content itself, but also fall short in elucidating the reasons behind the model's classification. Based on the above problems, we propose a fine-grained fake news detection method with implicit semantic enhancement. This method fully utilizes the summarization and reasoning capabilities of the existing generative large language model. The method employs inference based on major events, fine-grained minor events, and implicit information to systematically evaluate the authenticity of news content. This method strategically leverages the full potential of the model by decomposing tasks, thereby not only optimizing its proficiency but also significantly enhancing its prowess in capturing instances of fake news. Simultaneously, it is designed to be interpretable, providing a solid foundation for detection. With its inherent ability, this method not only ensures reliable identification but also holds vast potential for diverse applications. © 2024 Science Press.

However, it also poses the challenge of fake news, which can mislead and harm individuals physically, and mentally, and incite violence. Fake news is often known as incorrect or misleading information. Prior research used Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques for fake news detection. These studies predominantly relied on static offline models, overlooking the dynamic and evolving nature of news patterns, assuming their stability over time. Our paper proposes an incremental ensemble neural network for fake news detection that continuously learns from fake news streams, adapting to changes. It employs performance-based pruning to eliminate underperforming classifiers, improving overall performance. Additionally, the model detects concept drift in real-time and triggers adaptation strategies to maintain accuracy and robustness. The models undergo evaluation in two scenarios, utilizing consistent news patterns for training and testing, demonstrating consistent performance among all ML and incremental models. In the second scenario, the study analyzes the impact of news patterns over time, including concept drift due to significant events like the United States election. The analysis reveals that offline-trained methods are susceptible to performance degradation. However, the proposed model exhibits consistent performance with an accuracy of 97.90% and 99.76% on two fake news datasets, despite changes in the news pattern over time. The findings demonstrate how the evolution of the news pattern impacts the effectiveness of fake news detection models.

Since the information dissipation through online media is too quick, an efficient system is needed to detect and counter the propagation of fake news on social media. Many studies have been performed in last few years to detect fake news on social media. This study focuses on efficient detection of fake news on social media, through a Natural Language Processing based approach, using deep learning. For the detection of fake news, textual data have been analyzed in unidirectional way using sequential neural networks, or in bi-directional way using transformer architectures like Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). This paper proposes Contextualized Fake News Detection System (ConFaDe)-a deep learning based fake news detection system that utilizes contextual embeddings generated from a transformer-based model. The model uses Masked Language Modelling and Replaced Token Detection in its pre-training to capture contextual and semantic information in the text. The proposed system outperforms the previously set benchmarks for fake news detection; including state-of-the-art approaches on a real-world fake news dataset, when evaluated using a set of standard performance metrics with an accuracy of 99.9 % and F1 macro of 99.9%. In contrast to the existing state-of-the-art model, the proposed system uses 90 percent less network parameters and is 75 percent lesser in size. Consequently, ConFaDe requires fewer hardware resources and less training time, and yet outperforms the existing fake news detection techniques, a step forward in the direction of Green Artificial Intelligence. © 2024, Universidad Internacional de la Rioja.

Earlier, researchers have exploited various feature engineering approaches and deep learning models with embedding to capture incongruity between news headlines and their respective bodies. Studies have broadly considered different combinations of bag-of-words-based features, sequential encoding, hierarchical encoding, headline-guided attention-based encoding, and so on, of the text in headlines and bodies. In this article, we focus on addressing two important limitations observed with hierarchical encoding and headline-guided attention-based encoding methods. The existing hierarchical encoding-based studies limit the hierarchical structure of the body of a news article to paragraph level only, undermining the importance of incorporating long-term dependence from word level to sentence, paragraph, and body. Furthermore, the existing headline-guided attention-based encoding focuses on contextually similar contents in the body of the headline, undermining the importance of incorporating contextually dissimilar contents. Motivated by the above observations, this article proposes a gated recursive and sequential deep hierarchical encoding (GraSHE) method for detecting incongruent news articles by extending the hierarchical structure of the news body from the body to the word level and incorporating incongruity weight. From various experimental setups over three publicly available benchmarks datasets, the experimental results indicate that the proposed model outperforms baseline models with bag-of-word-based features, sequential, hierarchical, and headline-guided attention-based encoding methods. To further validate the performance of the proposed model, we conduct several ablation studies. The following key observations can be made from the ablation study: 1) models with hierarchical encoding outperform models with nonhierarchical encoding; 2) recursive encoding of sentences boosts the performance of models as compared with sequential encoding of sentences within paragraphs; and 3) incongruent news article detection is domain-dependent. Incorporating explicit features further boosts the performance of proposed model and also decreases the domain dependence of models. © 2014 IEEE.","Domain-dependent; encoding sentence structure; fake news detection; hierarchical encoding; incongruent news article detection; misinformation detection; misleading content detection; tree-long short-term memory (LSTM)","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149374480"

Although numerous fake news detection methods have been proposed and achieved some progress in recent years, almost all existing methods rely solely on global semantic features to detect fake news while ignoring that fake news is not consistently semantically similar. To fill the gap between news semantic feature space and fake news decision space, we propose a novel method, i.e., Contextual Semantic representation learning for multimodal Fake News Detection (CSFND), by introducing the context information into the representation learning process. Specifically, CSFND implements an unsupervised context learning stage to acquire the local context features of news, which are then fused with the global semantic features to learn the contextual semantic representation of news. In our proposed representation space, semantically dissimilar fake news is explicitly isolated and distinguished from real news separately. Moreover, CSFND devises a contextual testing strategy aimed at distinguishing between fake and real news within the data having similar semantics, wherein the learned decision boundaries are impervious to the semantic characteristics. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world multimodal datasets demonstrate that CSFND significantly outperforms ten state-of-the-art competitors in detecting fake news and outperforms the best baselines on two datasets by 2.5% on average in terms of Accuracy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; Fake news detection; Multimodal learning; Representation learning; Social network","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178469387"

Identifying and mitigating fake news is critical for protecting individuals, organizations, and broader society from the adverse effects of misinformation. However, conventional fake news detection methods, such as rule-based systems, supervised machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, are impeded by notable drawbacks. Rule-based strategies are rigid and inflexible, supervised learning models often fail to generalize beyond their training data, and NLP methods struggle to fully understand the subtleties and context of language. In response to these challenges, this study presents the Optimized Ensemble Machine and Deep Learning (OE-MDL) algorithm, a sophisticated approach designed to efficiently and accurately detect fake news. The OE-MDL algorithm enhances detection capabilities by incorporating a series of preprocessing steps: converting text to lowercase, tokenization, eliminating stop words, applying word stemming and lemmatization, and conducting spell-checks. It also involves generating n-grams and calculating term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) scores, capturing a wide spectrum of linguistic and statistical features that help distinguish between genuine and fraudulent news. The OE-MDL framework enhances classification precision and robustness by integrating optimized machine learning (OML) and optimized deep learning (ODL) phases. In the OML phase, advanced classifiers, including optimized RandomForest, J48, SMO, LSTM, NaiveBayes, and IBk, are amalgamated with an optimized Multilayer Perceptron serving as the Meta classifier. This amalgamation forms the foundation for a bagging classifier, which is then utilized within an AdaBoostM1 boosting classifier. Similarly, the ODL phase employs a Dl4jMlpClassifier as a basis for another bagging and AdaBoostM1 boosting sequence. The OML and ODL classifiers are then synergized through a blending classifier using weighted voting to accurately categorize the training data. The well-trained blending classifier is subsequently deployed to determine the authenticity of news articles in the test dataset. Empirical results underscore the superior performance of the OE-MDL algorithm, achieving unprecedented accuracy (99.87%), precision (99.88%), recall (95.87%), and F1-Score (99.96%). This performance indicates that the OE-MDL algorithm is an exceptionally effective tool in the ongoing battle against the proliferation of fake news, providing a robust and reliable means of upholding the integrity of information in the digital age. © 2024, Ismail Saritas.

The proliferation of fake news across various social media platforms poses enormous harm to society and affects the news industry’s credibility. Therefore, it is critical to develop effective automated algorithms to detect deceptive articles. We show that existing models for fake news detection based on deep learning have limitations in terms of generalizability when confronted with a variety of news sources. Current deep learning models frequently fail to generalize adequately across different datasets, resulting in inferior performance. In this paper, we investigate the performance of numerous deep learning models on multiple fake news datasets, each with distinct characteristics. Our goal is to assess these models’ performance within the same dataset and across other datasets in the domain of fake news. We aim to acquire useful insights into the models’ robustness and generalizability across multiple datasets. We carried out an extensive set of experiments with five deep-learning models and seven datasets. These models are tested within a domain and across domains, i.e., on the same domain where they are trained and on other domains that were not seen during training. Our results show that these models cannot be generalized over various datasets and domains. The results reveal that these models exhibit high accuracy (around 99%) when tested on the dataset they were trained on but they experience a significant drop in performance (around 30%) when evaluated on different datasets. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Cross-domain; Deep learning; Fake news detection","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192851118"

People comment and express their thoughts on any social media post. Meanwhile, fake news or misleading information is disseminated regarding exciting occurrences that occur in real time. A large number of Internet users read and distribute such false and fake material without knowing the nature or legitimacy of the news. This has a detrimental influence on people’s perceptions of the particular event. Classical techniques are utilized to determine the type of news distributed on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook. However, these techniques fail to take into account characteristics such as news-generating location, consistency, timing, and novelty. It eventually leads to a scenario in which individuals form incorrect ideas and have misleading perceptions regarding any startling news. The spread of misleading thoughts and remarks has a significant impact on real-world action results. This research article addresses these difficulties by developing a system for detecting fake news using deep learning techniques and models. To determine the originality of the news, place of generation, and longevity, two deep learning models are developed artificial neural network and a mixed classifier model of convolution neural networks and long short-term memory. This aids in detecting bogus news and removing it from the server where it is stored. The tests utilizing these coupled models increase the detection of false information in social media.

Although tremendous research effort has been devoted to extracting semantic information from news pieces and detecting fake news regarding their linguistic characteristics, the abundant factual information in knowledge graphs (KGs) has yet to be explored. There remain two significant challenges to utilizing KGs for fake news detection: 1) The unknown relation between existing knowledge and news content, and 2) fusing characters of fake news from both KGs and news content inherently requires balancing the contributions of these resources, but no prior domain knowledge is available. Therefore, we propose KEHGNN-FD, a novel KG-enhanced Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network, to unleash the power of KGs for fake news detection. We model news content, topics, and entities as a heterogeneous graph and use graph attention to learn high-level news representations by adaptively aggregating neighboring information from the heterogeneous graph and ground-truth KG entities (i.e., Wikidata). Finally, we train a semi-supervised detector to label news as fake or true. Extensive experiments on four fake news datasets show the superiority of KEHGNN-FD over seven baselines regarding accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC. The ablation study further validates the efficacy of the KG for fake news detection as well as KEHGNN-FD's components. © 1975-2011 IEEE.","anomaly detection; deep learning; Fake news detection; graph neural network; knowledge graph","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174836201"

Most of the recent works on the identification of fake news make use of deep learning and large language models to achieve high levels of performance. However, traditional fake news detection methods may lack a nuanced “understanding” of content, including ignoring important information in the form of potential aspects in documents or relying on external knowledge sources to identify such aspects. This paper focuses on aspect-based fake news detection, which aims to uncover deceptive narratives through fine-grained analysis of news articles. We propose a novel aspect-based fake news detection method based on a lower, paragraph-level attention mechanism that identifies different aspects within a news-related document. The proposed approach utilizes aspects to provide concise yet meaningful representations of long news articles without reliance on any external reference knowledge.

Emotional appeal in fake news is also a driving factor in its rapid dissemination. Although prior studies have made a remarkable effort toward fake news detection, they give less emphasis on exploring video modality and emotional appeal in fake news.

With an inimitable ability of AI to process and analyze any form of data (image, text, audio, and video) with the help of high-power computing machines, it is considered as an integral part of Industry 4.0. Social media and internet are another form of technology advancement in digital communication that has created a tremendous impact in the society. Social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram provide a platform for people to freely express their thoughts and views. The past decade is witnessing an awful side of social media through the dissemination of online fake news and hate speech content. Social networking sites make use of AI tools to tackle with the increasing hate speech and fake news content. Natural language processing (NLP), a field of AI, include techniques that process vast amount of online content accompanied with machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms that learn the representations of data for detection, classification, and prediction tasks. AI algorithms are considered as “black box” where the decisions made by the algorithms are sometimes biased and lack in transparency. Many state-of-art AI algorithms show low recall and low F1-score metric for diverse forms of hate speech and fake news. The inadequacy of explanations about the decisions made by AI for classification and prediction task is a crucial challenge that needs to be considered. Explainable AI (XAI) is an upcoming research field that has added a new dimension to AI which is “Explainability”. XAI shows a unique ability of interpreting and explaining the decisions made by ML models. This feature of XAI is deployed in various applications like autonomous vehicles and medical diagnostics. In context of social media content, XAI plays an important role in interpreting the diverse forms of hate speech and fake news. Literature studies have reported various XAI models like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) for detection of hate speech and fake news content. The paper aims to explore XAI models for detection and classification of hate speech and fake news on social media platforms as reported in the research literature. This paper provides a review of evaluation metrics that quantify the XAI technique used in hate speech and fake news detection. The paper leaps into the technical and ethical challenges involved when using XAI models to handle the nuance of online text published on social media platforms. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","Explainable AI; Fake news; Hate speech; LIME; SHAP","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187890375"

Identifying this fake news by manual analysis is a complex task. Hence, various researchers carried out an analysis on exploiting intelligent approaches to detect fake news. This work aims to propose a hybrid deep learning model for fake news detection. In these works, the news is verified in a unidirectional manner. Hence, there is a demand to change the present scenario and a new model is required for increasing the accuracy of the fake news detection. In this work, the deep learning (DL) model Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) with 3 Parallel-concatenated Convolutional Neural Networks (PCCNN) is utilised for fake news detection. For the feature extraction process, the methods like Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) are utilised. Finally, for optimising the weights of the neural network, the metaheuristic optimisation Enhanced Sun Flower Optimisation (ESFO) algorithm is used. The robustness of LSTM-PCCNN is compared with other deep learning models to verify its robustness.

The recent boom in multimedia technology and increased internet access has led us into a hyper-connected global world. But these networks are often observed as the conduit for propagating fake news, which may cause a severe problem to a healthy social environment and destroy the harmony between the users. This calls for a proper segregation tool to classify various news articles as real or fake. Numerous research has been done on this topic, including the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this work, we propose a deep learning based hybrid framework utilizing Word2Vec embedding and LSTM for fake news detection. As part of our approach, we generate Word2Vec embedding for obtaining vector representations of the news excerpts. The Word2Vec embeddings assist in generating context-free and data agnostic feature vectors for our news articles. The stacked LSTM layers process the extracted feature vectors to obtain the topic-relevant salient features for the news articles. This is followed by two fully connected dense layers for classifying whether the news excerpt under consideration is real or fake. We also perform hyperparameter tuning for achieving a better performance of our model. The proposed model is context-free and independent of datasets as well as topics for fake news detection. We compare the proposed method’s performance with some traditional Machine Learning baseline models, deep learning models, the pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) via transfer learning, and some recently proposed state-of-the-art models. These models are tested on four datasets belonging to different domains for both training and testing purposes.

In this study, we propose an emotion-driven framework that extracts emotions from the multimodal data to identify fake news. We use the vision transformer, which removes the irrelevant data from the images and enhances the overall classification accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that incorporates multimodal emotions to detect fake news in the multimodal data, comprising of images and text.

The goal of spreading fake news can easily mislead and manipulate the public’s opinion. Many previous researchers have proposed this domain using classification algorithms or deep learning techniques. However, machine learning algorithms still suffer from high margin error, which makes them unreliable as every algorithm uses a different way of prediction. Deep learning requires high computation power and a large dataset to operate the classification model. A filtering model with a consensus layer in a multi-tier model is introduced in this research paper. The multi-tier model filters the news label correctly predicted by the first two-tier layer. The consensus layer acts as the final decision when collision results occur in the first two-tier layer. The proposed model is applied to the WEKA software tool to test and evaluate the model from both datasets. Two sequences of classification models are used in this research paper: LR_DT_RF and LR_NB_AdaBoost. The best performance of sequence for both datasets is LR_DT_RF which yields 0.9892 F1-Score, 0.9895 Accuracy, and 0.9790 Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) for ISOT Fake News Dataset, and 0.9913 F1-Score, 0.9853 Accuracy, and 0.9455 MCC for CHECKED Dataset.

Existing multimodal approaches disregard the recent development results of vision pretraining, consequently, their visual feature extractor primarily uses early proposed convolutional neural networks, such as VGG and ResNet. Compared with vision Transformers, traditional convolution neural networks have insufficient ability to extract local semantics from images as well as capture the relationships between different regions in images, which may reduce the performance of multimodal methods. To address this issue, we propose a multimodal fake news detection framework based on vision Transformer(MDVT). By experimenting with different multi-modal combination methods and feature extractors on this framework, we get a top-performing which combined MacBERT text features and Swin Transformer image features through the maximum method, named MDVT-MS. Experimental studies on a widely used social media dataset Weibo demonstrate that MDVT-MS outperforms current state-of-The-Art multimodal detection methods by 4.4% in accuracy. This proves the effectiveness of the proposed method and shows that vision Transformer can be used as a new vision backbone for multimodal fake news detection. © 2023 ACM.","Deep learning; Fake news detection; Multi-modal analysis; Vision Transformer","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187554219"

Motivated by the ongoing discussion on the sustainability of machine learning algorithms, this paper discusses the usefulness of data reduction for fake news detection. This is accomplished by using the fuzzy transform (or F-transform for short), which has already been proven effective, in the literature, to reduce the training time. A Long Short Term Memory architecture is then employed for classification to determine the authenticity of the news. From the formal perspective, we discuss in general the role of the F-transform in a learning system. Regarding the numerical experiments, we use five publicly available datasets, trying different compression ratios and different types of F-transform, assessing accuracy, F1 score, training time and energy consumption with and without F-transform. Although the F-transform is a lossy compression technique, the results show a negligible variation in accuracy and F1-score when comparing results with and without F-transform (i.e. 1%–3% in most cases and around 10% in one case). This seems to be congruent with the theoretical achievement. Furthermore, the approach yields substantial training time and energy savings, with over 50% reduction in energy consumption. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Deep learning; Energy; F-transform; LSTM; Misinformation","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181048309"

The pervasive reach of news, however, has given rise to a significant concern: the proliferation of fake news. In response to this challenge, a shared task in DravidianLangTech EACL2024 was initiated to detect fake news and classify its types in the Malayalam language. The shared task consisted of two sub-tasks. Task 1 focused on a binary classification problem, determining whether a piece of news is fake or not. Whereas task 2 delved into a multi-class classification problem, categorizing news into five distinct levels. Our approach involved the exploration of various machine learning (RF, SVM, XGBoost, Ensemble), deep learning (BiLSTM, CNN), and transformer-based models (MuRIL, Indic-SBERT, m-BERT, XLM-R, Distil-BERT) by emphasizing parameter tuning to enhance overall model performance. As a result, we introduce a fine-tuned MuRIL model that leverages parameter tuning, achieving notable success with an F1-score of 0.86 in task 1 and 0.5191 in task 2. This successful implementation led to our system securing the 3rd position in task 1 and the 1st position in task 2.

Fake news is a growing source of apprehension in recent times for hate speech as well. For instance, the followers of various beliefs face constant discrimination and receive negative perspectives directed at them. Fake news is one of the most prominent reasons for various kinds of racism and stands at par with individual, interpersonal, and structural racism types observed worldwide yet it does not get much importance and remains to be neglected. In this paper, to mitigate racism, we address the fake news regarding beliefs related to Islam as a case study. Though fake news remained to be a concerning factor since the beginning of Islam, a significant increase has been noticed in it for the last three years. Additionally, the accessibility of social media platforms and the growth in their use have helped to propagate misinformation, hate speech, and unfavorable views about Islam. Based on these deductions, this study intends to categorize such anti-Islamic content and misinformation found in Twitter posts. Several preprocessing and data enhancement steps were employed on retrieved data. Word2vec and GloVe were implemented to derive deep features while TF-IDF and BOW were applied to derive textual features from the data respectively. Finally, the classification phase was performed using four Machine-based predictive analysis (ML) algorithms Random Forest (RF), Naïve Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a custom deep CNN. The results when compared with certain performance evaluation measures show that on average, ML-models perform better than the CNN for the utilized dataset. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

This highlights the urgent need for scalable automated detection solutions to combat the pervasive threat of fake news online. While machine learning methods often rely solely on semantic text analysis, evolving fake news campaigns mimic genuine news, employing tactics like bot networks and sophisticated language imitation. This renders text-based meth- ods increasingly vulnerable. To address this challenge,we propose a heterogeneous deep learning model that incorporates richer information beyond text, specifically dissemination structure features from social networks. These features capture aspects like user interactions, sharing patterns, and network topology, providing valuable insights into the spread of information. Our model leverages the sentiment and affects the enriched Alt dataset for text analysis. Instead of using a popular language model called BERT, we explore alternative pre-trained language models like the Sentence Transformer, which focuses on capturing con- textual sentence embeddings, or the Universal Language Model (ULMFiT), which excels at understanding semantic relationships within text. Additionally, we consider spaCy, a versatile NLP library offering similar functionalities for text processing and feature extraction. While The Quint Dataset Challenge Dataset lacks sentiment annotations, it could be a potential alternative to Alt depending on research goals. This network-aware approach achieves an impressive 95.27% accuracy on The Boom Live dataset and demonstrates generalizability to The Quint dataset with 92.1% accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness in combatting evolving fake news tactics. © 2024 IEEE.","Deep learning model; Fake news detection; Heterogeneous network features; Pre-trained language models; Sentiment analysis; Social networks","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208827740"

Meantime, false information comes from various sources and forms in large-scale social networks, which increases the difficulty of detection by simple Bayesian decision. Therefore, a method for detecting fake news in large-scale social networks based on a generalized Bayesian classifier is proposed. By using web crawlers to collect news in social network from multiple platforms such as entertainment, education, and medical diseases, and employing the HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search) algorithm to analyze webpage links, the accuracy of webpage target data retrieval is improved. A network data cleaning function is utilized to remove redundant and cluttered data from social network. A multi-modal Transformer model is employed to extract fusion features of text and image from large-scale social network data. By optimizing the Bayesian classifier using a greedy selection algorithm, a generalized Bayesian classifier is obtained. The extracted features of fake news from social networks are used as inputs to the generalized Bayesian classifier to obtain the prior probability of fake news in social networks. Based on this prior probability, evidence factors that meet the conditions of fake news in large-scale social networks are obtained. By evaluating the numerical values of these evidence factors, the classification and detection of fake news in large-scale social networks are achieved. Experimental results show that the maximum KL divergence value of the proposed method is 0.01, and the maximum Gini coefficient value is 0.1, indicating excellent performance in information cleaning and feature extraction. The maximum number of false positive results is only one sample, demonstrating its ability to accurately detect Fake News in social networks. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Fake News; Generalized Bayesian classifier; Greedy algorithm; Large-scale Network; Social Network","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209369467"

Today's deepfake video has been difficult to distinguish the authenticity by the naked eye. While this technology has brought many positive applications, these fake videos also pose a huge potential threat to our society, such as being used to create fake news and pornographic videos. Therefore, it is necessary to find a method to identify these fake videos. At present, the commonly used detection methods are based on feature information of single frame. The performance of these methods often depends on the selected dataset, and generalizes poorly across different datasets. At the same time, their detection performance on highly compressed video drops significantly. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a method to detect deep face forgery videos based on rPPG signal. This method improves generalization performance by using the inherent physiological features of the human body for fake detection. At the same time, the performance in detecting highly compressed video is improved by using a green single-channel based signal extraction method.

Hence, with the loads of information created daily related to politics, mainly together with education, it becomes impractical for human beings to be able to verify manually, and automated fact-checking techniques are most essential in handling this information overload. Research reveals that deep learning models, such as LSTM and BERT, outperform most traditional machine learning techniques, including Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes, which can achieve an average accuracy of 94.21%, while the former is good in semantic and long-range dependency. These methods crave some fundamental textual properties and NLP techniques such as TF-IDF, word embedding's, and stylistic features to function with good efficacy. Ensemble methods combine multiple classifiers to harness the power of several different classifiers in improving detection accuracy. Although challenged by the lack of labeled data in training these accurate models because it is difficult to distinguish fake content, context-specific analysis is required. Some studies have suggested semi-supervised learning and incorporation of user profile information for better accuracy. This is evident from the fact that deep learning techniques are far superior in the task of fake news detection among various models. However, challenges are always there. Future work might focus on developing robust models to manage the dynamic nature of false news, as well as expanding the variety of datasets and feature extraction techniques. © 2024 IEEE.","","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000697528"

It has widespread effects on denorphising the public trust, transmitting wrong or false information, damaging the stability of society as whole. These type of news are shared easily in a short time, which is seen in the social media platforms. There can be misinformation and manipulation of a massive number of people. To address this issue, we primarily focused on the fake news detections with deep learning models. In this work we investigate using five most image models which are Swin, ConvNeXt, VGG-19, BEiT and ResNet-50, which can be helpful in linear or non-linear ways for fake news detections, it can be a feature extraction process also, which might help in improving the detection performances of anti-fake news detectors and it also can be helpful to see the data easily and introduce experiments that might improve the robustness. Here, we are reporting this methodology to detect the fake news using these five image models for extracting the features and feeding the extracted features into the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to classify the given news is either real as fake or not. We performed experiments using the IFND dataset and tested our multi-faceted feature extraction strategy which has proven to be effective. Each model has its own potential and it makes a difference in itself, producing it's unique manufactured model and it could represents it's own diverse visually rich representations which can be very useful in discriminating fake news. To show the proof of concept, improving the impicity of discriminating towards detecting fake news by using different image models, we extensively performed a comparison analysis for the state-of-the-art image models. By these extensive analysis, we attained the test accuracy of 88.66% on using Convnext-Tiny architecture and 91% F1 score while using the swin transformer architecture. The extensive analysis provides the relative advantages and disadvantages of the image models. This work gives a solid and powerful approach to tackle the spreading of fake news and sets a new benchmark to the research community in future research related to fake news detection. The work demonstrates the robust and effective fake news detection methods for precise information diffusion. © 2024 IEEE.","BEiT; CNN; Convnext; IFND; Image; ResNet50; VGG-19; Vision Transformer","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212980507"

Most often, fake news spreads faster than real news and misleads society. Many works have been proposed in the literature using machine learning techniques to detect fake news, but developing a faster and more efficient model is still a challenging issue. Taking advantage of the deep neural network features of long- and short-term memory (LSTM) and metaheuristic optimisation algorithms, this paper proposes a Salp swarm algorithm-based optimised LSTM model to efficiently classify fake and real news in online social networks. To figure out the superiority of the model, it is experimentally demonstrated that the proposed model outperforms the LSTM optimised with other traditional optimisations. We tested the efficiency of the models on three datasets: the LIAR benchmark dataset, the ISOT dataset, and the news regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, and obtained accuracy of 97.89%, 86.49%, and 99.71%, respectively.

The widespread proliferation of fake news not only fosters misinformation but also undermines the credibility of news sources. The veracity of the information is a major concern at all the stages of generation, publication, and propagation. To comprehend the critical need for addressing this pervasive problem, this research paper presents a framework for automatic detection of fake news using a knowledge-based approach. An automatic fact checking mechanism is applied using concepts of Information Retrieval (IR), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Graph theory. The knowledge base is generated using Twitter dataset, which basically contains four attributes: Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triplet, SPO sentiment polarity, SPO occurrence, and topic modeling. These attributes serve as pivotal indicators for the development of a knowledge base, subsequently employed to detect prevalent patterns and traits linked to deceptive or false information. We have employed Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to extract SPO triples and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling, thereby contributing to knowledge base generation. To evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed model, we utilize deep learning algorithms like RNN, GRU, LSTM, GPT-3 and BERT Transformer providing an acceptable level of accuracy.

We are now conducting research to find useful techniques to detect this false news, and the designed system is known as deep learning enabled an automated Fake News Detection (FND) system. The categorization or identification of fake news in online social media platforms has drawn more interest from the machine learning community. Misleading news refers to news stories that purposefully mislead readers by disseminating false information. In this post, we suggest a solution for social media platforms that automatically detects bogus news. Pre-processing, extraction of features, feature optimization, and classification were the four processes employed by the suggested system. Here, the concept of Term Frequency-Inverted Document Frequency (TF-IDF)-based approach is used as the feature extraction scheme and the extracted features are optimized using the concept of swarm-based Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) by designing an appropriate and novel fitness/objective function. ABC creates two categories of news, first as Fake and second as Real. Based on these categories, further Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to train the FND model. To verify the effectiveness of the suggested FND model, parameters like Precision, Recall, and F-measure (PRF) with Accuracy are computed. Finally, I assess how the suggested FND system performs in comparison to current models. to validate the performance in terms of PRF and we observed that the FND system got better results with accuracy of 99% for most of the cases. © 2024 IEEE.","ABC; CNN; Fake News Analysis; Internet; Social-Media; TF-IDF Feature Extraction","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205544110"

Our approach involves creating an intelligent framework to categorize text as either fake or original. We experimented with various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes, SVM, and SGD, and various deep learning models, including CNN, BiLSTM, and BiLSTM + Attention. We also explored Indic-BERT, MuRIL, XLM-R, and m-BERT for transformer-based approaches.

Hence, the need for improved detection of both human-created and AI-generated fake news using advanced AI models is critical. This paper proposes a survey to assess knowledge and attitudes towards news and AI, combining demographic data, personality traits, and the ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated news. Additionally, we create a new dataset, ERAF-News, containing real, fake, AI-generated true, and AI-generated fake news. To classify different types of news, we developed a dual-stream transformer model, DuSTraMo. This model leverages the capabilities of two parallel transformers to enhance the accuracy of news classification. The survey, involving 83 participants from 9 countries, revealed that respondents struggle to differentiate human-generated from AI-generated news. Notably, BERT outperformed GPT-2 and BART in generating realistic text, and RoBERTa and DistilBERT achieved over 98% accuracy in fake news classification. Dual-GPT models also showed high accuracy. This study underscores the effectiveness of the DuSTraMo model and the ERAF-News dataset in enhancing the detection of both human-created and AI-generated fake news. The findings highlight the increasing dominance of AI in this domain and the pressing need for advanced methods to combat fake news. Additionally, a survey examining users’ responses to fake news reveals a concerning inability to accurately identify false information. © 2024 Slovene Society Informatika.

This paper aims to shed light on low-resource languages, particularly the Algerian dialect, through an experimental study with two objectives. The first one is to verify if the automatic translation from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) to the Algerian dialect can be considered an approach to increase the resources in the Algerian dialect, especially with the rise of large language models (LLMs). The second is to verify the impact of the translation-based data augmentation method on fake news detection by using transformer-based Arabic pre-trained models in different data augmentation configurations. We have discovered that LLMs can generate translations that closely resemble human translations. In this study, we demonstrate that data augmentation can result in saturation and a decline in model performance due to the introduction of noise and variations in writing styles. © 2024 The Authors.

Propagation of fake news through the Internet has become rampant due to digitalisation, and the spread of fake news can cause irreparable damage to the victims. The conventional approach to fake news detection is time-consuming, hence introducing fake news detection systems. Existing fake news detection systems have yielded low accuracy and are unsuitable in Nigeria. Objective: This research aims to design and implement a framework for fake news detection using the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. Methodology: The dataset for the model was obtained from Nigerian dailies and Kaggle and pre-processed by removing punctuation marks and stop words, stemming, tokenisation and one hot representation. Feature extraction was done on the datasets to remove outliers. The locally acquired dataset from Nigeria was balanced using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Techniques (SMOTE) Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), a variant of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-which solved the problem of losing gained knowledge and information over a long period faced by RNN-was used as the detection model This model was implemented using Python 3.9. The model detected fake news by classifying real and fake news approaches. The dataset was fed into the model, and the model classified them as either fake or real news by processing the dataset through input and hidden layers of varying numbers of neurons. accuracy F1 score and detection time were used as the evaluation metrics. The results were then compared to some selected machine learning models and a hybrid of convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory models (CNN-LSTM). Results: The result shows that the LSTM model on a balanced dataset performed best as the two news classes were accurately classified, giving an average detection accuracy of 92.86%, which took the model 0.42 seconds to detect whether news was real or fake. Also, 87.50% average detection accuracy was obtained from an imbalanced dataset. Compared to other machine learning models, SVM and CNN-LSTM gave 81.25% accuracy for imbalanced datasets and 82.14% and 78.57% for balanced datasets, respectively. Conclusion: The outcome of this research shows that the deep learning approach outperformed some machine learning models for fake news detection in terms of performance accuracy. Unique contribution: This work has contributed knowledge by employing an LSTM model for detecting Nigerian fake news using an indigenous dataset. Key Recommendation: Future research should increase the data size of indigenous datasets for fake news detection to achieve improved accuracy. © 2023, University of Nigeria Department of Mass Communication.

Individuals often place unwavering trust in social networks, often without discerning the origins and authenticity of the information disseminated through these platforms. Hence, the identification of media-rich fake news necessitates an approach that adeptly leverages multimedia elements and effectively enhances detection accuracy. The ever-changing nature of cyberspace highlights the need for measures that may effectively resist the spread of media-rich fake news while protecting the integrity of information systems. This study introduces a robust approach for fake news detection, utilizing three publicly available datasets: WELFake, FakeNewsNet, and FakeNewsPrediction. We integrated FastText word embeddings with various Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods, further refining these algorithms with regularization and hyperparameter optimization to mitigate overfitting and promote model generalization. Notably, a hybrid model combining Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory, enriched with FastText embeddings, surpassed other techniques in classification performance across all datasets, registering accuracy and F1-scores of 0.99, 0.97, and 0.99, respectively.

All of these models were used in evaluation which of them is the best model in the process of fake news detection for the Arabic Language Dataset.The findings demonstrate strong performance across deep learning models, with CNN-LSTM, Bi-LSTM and CNN-Bi-LSTM exhibiting the best accuracy rates of 93.2% ,92.6%, 93.6% respectively. The LSTM model achieves a moderate accuracy of 87.4%, whilst the RNN model demonstrates a more modest accuracy of 56.8%. The results emphasize the capability of deep learning methods in reducing the dissemination of fake information in Arabic-language datasets. © 2024 IEEE.","Arabic Fake News; Bi-LSTM; Classification; Classifier; CNN-Bi-LSTM; Deep Learning; Features Extraction; GPT-3; LSTM; Machine Learning; Mining; RNN; Tokenization; Transformers","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000005631"

So, the number of online users is increasing day by day, which is also increasing fake news across the internet. This fake news must be detected and removed from the internet before causing damage to the nation’s peace. Social media platforms use fake news recognition algorithms to detect and remove misinformation from their platforms. However, these algorithms can fail when they misidentify satirical or humorous content as fake news. News organizations use fake news recognition technology to fact-check articles and ensure the accuracy of their reporting. However, these algorithms may fail to detect more sophisticated forms of misinformation, such as deep fakes or highly persuasive disinformation campaigns, leading to the spread of false information. Existing framework contains three main modules: information retrieval, natural language processing, and machine learning. Also has two phases: the data collection phase and the machine learning model-building phase. In the data collection phase, we obtained a data set and analyzed the data using natural language processing techniques to extract good features from web data.

This paper presents the participation of team Punny_Punctuators in the Fake News Detection in Dravidian Languages shared task at DravidianLangTech@EACL 2024, addressing this gap. The shared task focuses on two subtasks: 1. classifying social media texts as original or fake, and 2. categorizing fake news into 5 categories. We experimented with various machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and transformer-based models as well as processing techniques such as transliteration. Malayalam-BERT achieved the best performance on both sub-tasks, which obtained us 2nd place with a macro f1-score of 0.87 for the subtask-1 and 11th place with a macro f1-score of 0.17 for the subtask-2.

To address this issue, we urgently need effective ways to detect and mitigate fake news in the Bengali language. This paper highlights the unique challenges associated with linguistic diversity and misinformation prevalence. Our research introduces a hybrid deep learning algorithm specifically designed to classify fake and authentic Bengali news articles. The methodology involves extensive data collection, rigorous preprocessing to improve textual quality, and the use of advanced feature extraction methods. We combined and trained CNN and LSTM/BiLSTM models to handle the nuances of Bengali text. Our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing models, with a high accuracy of 98.45% in distinguishing between fake and authentic news and reducing false positives. Additionally, we developed a user-friendly web application that allows general public to input news articles and obtain predictions on their authenticity in real-time. This study not only advances the field of fake news detection but also provides essential tools for journalists, policymakers, and the general public to combat misinformation in Bengali media.

However, social networking sites have also occasionally been used for immoral and illegal actions. People’s mental and physical health has gotten worse as a result of bogus news being spread on social media during the COVID-19 epidemic. Thus, a number of research have been conducted to automatically detect the false information about COVID-19 using a variety of intelligent algorithms in order to control the flow of false information about the novel coronavirus. However, the performance of the forecasting models has varied according to investigations. In this research, we offer an intelligent model for the automatic identification of fake news about healthcare utilizing machine learning and deep learning principles.

Users think that it is easier to follow the agenda by accessing news, especially on Twitter, rather than newspaper news pages. However, fake news is increasingly appearing on social media, and it is not always possible for people to obtain correct news from partial news pages or short Twitter posts. Understanding whether the news shared on Twitter is true or not is an important problem. Detecting fake tweets is of great importance in Turkish as well as in any language. In this study, fake news obtained from verification platforms on Twitter and real news obtained from the Twitter accounts of mainstream newspapers were labeled and, preprocessed using the Zemberek natural language processing tool developed for the Turkish language, and a dataset named TR_FaRe_News was created. Then, the TR_FaRe_News dataset was explored using ensemble methods and BoW, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec vectorization methods for fake news detection. Then a pre-trained BERT deep learning model was fine-tuned, and variations of the model extended with Bi-LSTM and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers with the frozen and unfrozen parameters methods were explored. The performance evaluation was conducted using seven comparable datasets, namely BuzzFeedNews, GossipCop, ISOT, LIAR, Twitter15, and Twitter16, including an LLM-generated fake news dataset. Analyzing Turkish tweets and using fake news datasets generated by LLM is considered an important contribution.

Because of the blathering social media discourse, the idea of ""fake news""has recently evolved. Wide-ranging consequences of fake news dissemination include the development of distorted opinions and the tampering of election outcomes to benefit specific politicians. Spammers also use captivating news headlines to entice readers to click on their advertisements. These days, it can be quite difficult to tell if the news we hear is accurate. There aren't many methods for assessing authenticity, and the ones that are accessible are all difficult and beyond the capabilities of the average person. A fact-checking platform that gives us that chance is desperately needed. Deep Learning (DL) approaches are suited for more accurately and efficiently detecting false news because of their recent accomplishments in difficult natural language processing tasks. The suggested approach is a multi-layered, optimal CNN model for detecting fake news. The OPCNN and Word embedding are optimized for feature extraction using the hyperopt optimization method in order to produce highly accurate results. In this study, we generated word embeddings using the FastText technique. The purpose of the model is to identify news stories published in Malayalam that are either false or misleading. The model is trained on 80% of a newly compiled Malayalam dataset consisting of news articles from various online sources having 11,686 news items with 5843 false and real news entries apiece and then evaluated on the remaining 20%. The evaluation's findings show that the suggested model works better than current methods and has a high degree of accuracy when it comes to identifying false information in Malayalam.  © 2024 IEEE.","Fake News; FastText; Hyperopt; OPCNN; Word Embeddings","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001324558"

It is crucial to provide fact-checking tools capable of determining the authenticity of news content, images, and videos. Despite the increasing penetration of fake news in Arabic countries, fake news detection in this context has received limited attention. This work focuses on developing an efficient approach to accurately identify fake news while also measuring the uncertainty of its predictions, a crucial aspect that has been overlooked in the field. We propose a powerful deep ensemble model that incorporates various multi-input merging techniques and different architectures. Our proposed architecture comprises a deep ensemble of three distinct models, each designed to handle specific types of inputs. The ensemble consists of Bi-Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model utilizing embedded inputs, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model incorporating only metadata, and a DNN model employing the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) matrix. Additionally, we compute uncertainty of this detection. We further utilize a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) architecture specifically for metadata to independently measure uncertainty and to give a qualitative evaluation of our uncertainty measure. Experimental results on a challenging dataset demonstrate that our proposed ensemble model outperforms previous works in terms of per-formance. Furthermore, by leveraging the BNN, we showcase how our ensemble architecture surpasses the standalone BNN in uncertainty accuracy.

They may contain claims such as political propaganda or aggressive content like bullying or harassment phrases. Sharing such fake news results to many struggles like hate speeches and aggressive actions in society so identifying fake and real news is a necessary requirement. Providing such a requirement in multiple languages is important and in this research, our aim is to develop a system able to detect fake news in both Arabic and English language based on textual features. The difference between the two datasets is the preprocessing phase Arabic needs more preprocessing due to the punctuation. This paper uses deep learning and machine learning algorithms for the detection of fake news in Arabic and English. For the English dataset, machine learning models such as gradient boost, logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest were employed, along with deep learning models like GAN, RNN, and LSTM. We employed random forest, decision tree, and logistic regression as machine learning models and LSTM, GAN, and RNN as deep learning models for the Arabic dataset. According to experimental results, the Arabic dataset yields the highest accuracy of 85% for LSTM and GAN, while the English dataset yields the highest accuracy of 99% for gradient boosting.  © 2024 IEEE.","deep learning; detection; machine learning; textual features","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204367610"

It helps them to connect with each other and can also be used as a medium to spread fake news. Such misinformation can be very dangerous as it can misguide youth and other age groups to take adverse steps leading to violence and other crimes. Hence efforts are needed to classify social media news as fake or real. Earlier lot of efforts have been made to classify news articles from their text by creating natural language processing deep learning models. Since, these days social media depends a lot on images hence it is needed that both text and associated images must be analyzed to know the fakeness of a news article. Thus multimodal deep learning models have been introduced which can extract features from both images and associated text and then fuse these features to pass to a classification output layer. Using this approach it was found that classification with both data as input an accuracy of 74.4% was obtained on a publicly available dataset. ©2024 IEEE.","1-D CNN; Fake News; Multimodal; Pre-trained CNN","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202638207"

One of the primary impediments to addressing this issue is the lack of resources and tools specifically tailored for low-resource languages. Existing research predominantly focuses on English content, limiting the applicability of findings to a narrow linguistic spectrum. Moreover, the rise of multimedia content on the web has exacerbated the dissemination of misinformation, as authentic multimedia elements are repurposed to mislead readers. To confront this evolving challenge, this paper presents a novel approach comprising two main contributions. Firstly, we introduce a pioneering multilingual misinformation dataset, spanning English and Hindi, developed from scratch to address the scarcity of resources in low-resource languages. This dataset is enriched with background knowledge sourced from authentic sources, providing crucial context for detecting misleading articles. Secondly, we propose an effective neural model that leverages Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and mixture of 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1DCNN) and BiLSTM to identify fabricated information across languages. In a world where the accuracy of truth is constantly challenged by misinformation, our system emerges as a steadfast guardian, bolstered by innovative methodologies and linguistic inclusivity. Through rigorous experimentation, we have substantially elevated its accuracy in multilingual misinformation detection, surmounting resource limitations and propelling detection capabilities across diverse linguistic landscapes. © 2024 IEEE.","deep learning; fake news detection; multilingual; natural language processing","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212966674"

These have fundamentally altered the landscape of information sharing, with potentially harmful effects on individuals and societies, posing a real threat to the reliability of information. The problem is intensified by the lack of adequate procedures to combat fake news. Consequently, the detection of unfounded fake news has become an urgent issue in media contxt. Although various studies have developed machine learning models to detect fake news in several languages, significant gaps remain in addressing this issue in the Arabic language. This article fills these gaps by analyzing the detection of fake news in Arabic through textual content and their sources, also by using a transfer learning method based on BERT. The study used a large database of over 606,912 news articles covering multiple domains collected from 134 Arabic news websites. Our approach includes innovative feature extraction techniques such as n-grams and document engineering to improve model performance.

In recent times, fake news content on social media has become one of the major challenging problems for society. The dissemination of fabricated and false news articles includes multimodal data in the form of text and images. The previous methods have mainly focused on unimodal analysis. Moreover, for multimodal analysis, researchers fail to keep the unique characteristics corresponding to each modality. This article aims to overcome these limitations by proposing an efficient transformer-based multilevel attention (ETMA) framework for multimodal fake news detection, which comprises the following components: a visual attention-based encoder, a textual attention-based encoder, and joint attention-based learning. Each component utilizes different forms of attention mechanisms and uniquely deals with multimodal data to detect fraudulent content. The efficacy of the proposed network is validated by conducting several experiments on four real-world fake news datasets: Twitter, Jruvika fake news dataset, Pontes fake news dataset, and Risdal fake news dataset using multiple evaluation metrics. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods on all four datasets. Furthermore, the computation time of the model is also lower than the state-of-the-art methods. © 2014 IEEE.","Attention networks; deep learning; fake news; multimodal analysis; Transformer","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151495460"

In response to these challenges, researchers have made notable progress in classifying Bangla news using deep learning techniques and language models like BERT. This study presents a detailed exploration of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model tailored for categorizing Bangla news articles as authentic or counterfeit. By integrating BERT (Bangla Electra) into the model’s architecture, an impressive accuracy rate of 94.33% was achieved, with our proprietary model surpassing this at 94.5%.To ensure the reliability of results, a range of NLP techniques were applied during data preprocessing, including data cleansing, tokenization, stop word and punctuation removal, and stemming.

While existing deep-learning based methods have made progress in detecting fake news accurately, their reliability may be compromised caused by the non-transparent reasoning processes, poor generalization abilities and inherent risks of integration with large language models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we propose TELLER, a novel framework for trustworthy fake news detection that prioritizes explainability, generalizability and controllability of models. This is achieved via a dual-system framework that integrates cognition and decision systems, adhering to the principles above. The cognition system harnesses human expertise to generate logical predicates, which guide LLMs in generating human-readable logic atoms. Meanwhile, the decision system deduces generalizable logic rules to aggregate these atoms, enabling the identification of the truthfulness of the input news across diverse domains and enhancing transparency in the decision-making process. Finally, we present comprehensive evaluation results on four datasets, demonstrating the feasibility and trustworthiness of our proposed framework.

Therefore, it is crucial to identify and restrict the dissemination of false information. Numerous deep learning models that make use of natural language processing have yielded excellent results in the detection of fake news. bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), based on transfer learning, is one of the most advanced models. In this work, the researchers have compared the earlier studies that employed baseline models versus the research articles where the researchers used a pretrained model BERT for the detection of fake news. The literature analysis revealed that utilizing pretrained algorithms is more effective at identifying fake news because it takes less time to train them and yields better results. Based on the results noted in this article, the researchers have advised the utilization of pretrained models that have already been taught to take advantage of transfer learning, which shortens training time and enables the use of large datasets, as well as a reputable model that performs well in terms of precision, recall, as well as the minimum number of false positive and false negative outputs. As a result, the researchers created an improved BERT model, while considering fine-tuning it to meet the demands of the fake news identification assignment. To obtain the most accurate representation of the input text, the final layer of this model is also unfrozen and trained on news texts. The dataset used in the study included 23502 articles of fake news and 21417 items of actual news. This dataset was downloaded from the Kaggle website. The results of this study demonstrated that the proposed model showed a better performance compared with other models, and achieved 99.96% and 99.96% in terms of accuracy and F1 score, respectively. © 2014 IEEE.","Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT); fake news; pretrained model; social networks","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144059021"

This issue has become a focus of interest among various research communities, including artificial intelligence (AI) researchers. Existing AI-based fake news detection techniques primarily make use of a 1-D convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) with unidirectional word embedding. We propose a multichannel deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with different kernel sizes and filters as an AI technique. Multiple embedding of the same dimension with different kernel sizes technically allows the news article to be processed at different resolutions of different n-grams at the same time. Different kernel sizes increase the learning ability of the proposed classification model. The proposed model determines how to integrate these interpretations (different n-grams) most suitably. Three real-world fake news datasets were used in experiments to validate the classification performance. The classification results showed that the proposed model has high accuracy in detecting fake news.

Despite the fact that there are several fact-checking blogs and websites that distinguish between news that is genuine or fake, and regardless of the reality that there is ongoing research being conducted to restrict the propagation of fake news, the issue is still one that needs to be addressed. The most major barrier is a failure to spot monitors and to disclose false news in a reasonable timeframe, both of which are critical components. In this research, a system is proposed that utilizes deep learning model of Recurrent Neural Network—Long Short-Term Memory (RNN-LSTM) in order to put an end to the circulation of misleading information and put a stop to, and expose instances of fake news that are spread through reliable channels. The process of extracting hybrid features from text data, such as Lemmas, Bi-Gram, Tri-Gram, N-gram, Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), part-of-speech, and dependency-based natural language processing features, is developed as a strategy. When compared to other traditional approaches to machine learning classifier, the RNN-LSTM method that was proposed obtains a greater level of accuracy than those other approaches. It achieves an accuracy rate of 99.10% both during training and testing, which is better to the accuracy achieved by common machine learning approaches such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Decision Tree (DT). In the proposed approach for detecting false news using RNN-LSTM, the three experiments are conducted to acquire, accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score with varying forms of cross validation (5-Fold, 10-Fold and 15-Fold). Based on the findings of the empirical research, the conclusion can be drawn that the RNN-LSTM with ReLu function provides more accurate detection than both the RNN-LSTM (Tan h) function and the RNN-LSTM (sigmoid) function with 15 fold cross validation. © 2023 by author(s).","fake news detection; machine learning classifiers; RNN-LSTM","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181503242"

In this study, we offer a thorough investigation of sentiment analysis using the sophisticated fusion architecture of 1D convolutional neural networks (1DCNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BI-LSTM). In order to understand the performance and ramifications of Glove and Word2Vec, two of the most notable word embeddings in the context of sentiment determination, they are compared in this investigation. The study encompasses a comprehensive assessment of critical performance indicators, mainly recall, accuracy, precision, and F1-score. Preliminary results conspicuously reveal a marked superiority of the BiLSTM+1DCNN model interfaced with Glove embeddings when juxtaposed against the Word2Vec variant. More specifically, the Glove-integrated model exhibited commendable precision values of 82% for positive sentiments and 78% for negative sentiments. Concurrently, recall metrics stood at 79% for positive and 80% for negative sentiments, leading to an impressive F1-score of 81% Positive sentiments and 82% for negative sentiment classes. This augmented performance is attributable to Glove's intricate semantic captures, owed to its training on extensive and diverse text corpora, thereby ensuring richer contextual information retrieval. In the quest to offer a visual and intuitive understanding, the research presents a suite of graphical representations: the accuracy graph elucidating model performance progression over epochs, the loss graph signifying the model's error rate, and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) graph portraying the model's capability in distinguishing sentiment polarities. A specialized comparison graph crystallizes the performance disparities between the two embeddings, fortifying the argument in favour of Glove's supremacy. Conclusively, the research underscores the paramountcy of selecting the apt embedding, with the Glove-based BiLSTM+1DCNN model emerging as the frontrunner for sentiment analytics tasks, owing to its impeccable balance between precision and recall, culminating in a laudable 83% accuracy. © 2024, Ismail Saritas.

The fast flow of information and the enormous number of users opens the door to the publication of non-truthful news, which has the potential to reach many people. Disseminating this news through low- or no-cost channels resulted in a flood of fake news that is difficult to detect by humans. Social media networks are one of these channels that are used to quickly spread this fake news by manipulating it in ways that influence readers in many aspects. That influence appears in a recent example amid the COVID-19 pandemic and various political events such as the recent US presidential elections. Given how this phenomenon impacts society, it is crucial to understand it well and study mechanisms that allow its timely detection. Deep learning (DL) has proven its potential for multiple complex tasks in the last few years with outstanding results. In particular, multiple specialized solutions have been put forward for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper, we systematically review existing fake news detection (FND) strategies that use DL techniques. We systematically surveyed the existing research articles by investigating the DL algorithms used in the detection process. Our focus then shifts to the datasets utilized in previous research and the effectiveness of the different DL solutions. Special attention was given to the application of strategies for transfer learning and dealing with the class imbalance problem. The effect of these solutions on the detection accuracy is also discussed. Finally, our survey provides an overview of key challenges that remain unsolved in the context of FND.  © 2024 IEEE.","Classification; deep learning; fake news; misinformation; systematic literature review","Review","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200253242"

Machine learning and deep learning techniques have shown promise in automatically detecting fake news, but there is still room for improvement. In this paper, we propose an innovative fuzzy logic-based hybrid model to improve the performance of fake news detection. The model leverages a combination of news articles and textual and numerical context information.

Efforts to counter this issue have led to research in deep learning and machine learning methods. However, a gap exists in effectively using contextual cues and skip connections within models, limiting the development of comprehensive detection systems that harness contextual information and vital data propagation. Thus, we propose a model of deep learning, FakeStack, in order to identify bogus news accurately. The model combines the power of pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representation of Transformers (BERT) embeddings with a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) having skip convolution block and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The model has been trained and tested on English fake news dataset, and various performance metrics were employed to assess its effectiveness. The results showcase the exceptional performance of FakeStack, achieving an accuracy of 99.74%, precision of 99.67%, recall of 99.80%, and F1-score of 99.74%. Our model’s performance was extended to two additional datasets. For the LIAR dataset, our accuracy reached 75.58%, while the WELFake dataset showcased an impressive accuracy of 98.25%. Comparative analysis with other baseline models, including CNN, BERT-CNN, and BERT-LSTM, further highlights the superiority of FakeStack, surpassing all models evaluated.

We use non-entailment probability for the original and generated texts as a loss function for a transformer-based sequence-tosequence model. The proposed approach has demonstrated the effectiveness on three classification benchmarks in fake news detection in terms of the F1-score macro and ROC AUC. Moreover, we showed that our approach retains the class label of the original text more accurately than other transformer-based methods. © 2023 Incoma Ltd.

This false information is harmful to society and individuals. Blocking and detecting the spread of fake news in Arabic becomes critical. Several artificial intelligence (AI) methods, including contemporary transformer techniques, BERT, were used to detect fake news. Thus, fake news in Arabic is identified by utilizing AI approaches. This article develops a new hunter-prey optimization with hybrid deep learning-based fake news detection (HPOHDL-FND) model on the Arabic corpus. The HPOHDL-FND technique undergoes extensive data pre-processing steps to transform the input data into a useful format. Besides, the HPOHDL-FND technique utilizes long-term memory with a recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) model for fake news detection and classification. Finally, hunter prey optimization (HPO) algorithm is exploited for optimal modification of the hyperparameters related to the LSTM-RNN model. The performance validation of the HPOHDL-FND technique is tested using two Arabic datasets. The outcomes exemplified better performance over the other existing techniques with maximum accuracy of 96.57% and 93.53% on Covid19Fakes and satirical datasets, respectively. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

The rise of social media, which many users consider the main source of news, has exacerbated this issue because individuals can easily disseminate fake news more quickly and inexpensive with fewer checks and filters than traditional news media. Numerous approaches have been explored to automate the detection and prevent the spread of fake news. However, achieving accurate detection requires addressing two crucial aspects: obtaining the representative features of effective news and designing an appropriate model. Most of the existing solutions rely solely on content-based features that are insufficient and overlapping. Moreover, most of the models used for classification are constructed with the concept of a dense features vector unsuitable for short news sentences. To address this problem, this study proposed a Web-Informed-Augmented Fake News Detection Model using Stacked Layers of Convolutional Neural Network and Deep Autoencoder called ICNN-AEN-DM. The augmented information is gathered from web searches from trusted sources to either support or reject the claims in the news content. Then staked layers of CNN with a deep autoencoder were constructed to train a probabilistic deep learning-base classifier. The probabilistic outputs of the stacked layers were used to train decision-making by staking multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers to the probabilistic deep learning layers. The results based on extensive experiments challenging datasets show that the proposed model performs better than the related work models. It achieves 26.6% and 8% improvement in detection accuracy and overall detection performance, respectively. Such achievements are promising for reducing the negative impacts of fake news on communities. © 2023 by the authors.","augmented information; CNN; deep autoencoder; deep learning; fake news detection; misinformation; stacked learning; two-stage classification; web-informed","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159217708"

Due to the vast influence of such false news and the growing user reach of technical media sources (TV, Internet, social media, blogs). Humans have become more dependent on the news as they make daily decisions for ensuring the safety of their loved ones and themselves in the wake of COVID-19 becoming a pandemic which has impacted humans all over the world. Fake news, on the other hand, is on the verge of becoming a ""second pandemic"" or ""infodemic, "" endangering the health of individuals all over the world. Previous research hasn't used fake news detection to coronavirus in Arabic due to the fact that fake news connected to coronavirus is such a recent occurrence. A total of 4 versions of the datasets used in this study have been produced (D0, D1, D2, and D3). To understand the effects of deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) techniques on any dataset, a total of 4 datasets were created. Also, the research analyzes them with regard to ML and DL to determine the efficacy of preprocessing (D1), raw dataset (D0), light stemming (D3), and root stemming (D2). Dataset version zero (D0) is finished when creating an excel file. From the first version (D0), three more versions (D2, D1, and D3) were created.

To minimize the harm caused by false information, understanding its sensitivity and content is essential. This research analyzes the characteristics of human expression and, based on the results, successfully detects fake news by implementing different machine learning models. To identify false information on the Internet, we propose an ensemble model based on transformers. First, various text classification tasks were conducted to understand the contents of false and true news about COVID-19. The proposed hybrid ensemble learning model utilizes these results. The results of our analysis were encouraging, demonstrating that the proposed system can identify false information on social media platforms. All the classification tasks were validated and displayed outstanding results. The final model exhibited excellent accuracy (0.99) and fl score (0.99). The Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve showed that the true-positive rate of the data in this model was close to one, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) score was very high at 0.99.

Over the past few decades, research on anomaly mining has received increasing interests due to the implications of these occurrences in a wide range of disciplines - for instance, security, finance, and medicine. For this reason, anomaly detection, which aims to identify these rare observations, has become one of the most vital tasks in the world and has shown its power in preventing detrimental events, such as financial fraud, network intrusions, and social spam. The detection task is typically solved by identifying outlying data points in the feature space, which, inherently, overlooks the relational information in real-world data. At the same time, graphs have been prevalently used to represent the structural/relational information, which raises the graph anomaly detection problem - identifying anomalous graph objects (i.e., nodes, edges and sub-graphs) in a single graph, or anomalous graphs in a set/database of graphs. Conventional anomaly detection techniques cannot tackle this problem well because of the complexity of graph data (e.g., irregular structures, relational dependencies, node/edge types/attributes/directions/multiplicities/weights, large scale, etc.). However, thanks to the advent of deep learning in breaking these limitations, graph anomaly detection with deep learning has received a growing attention recently. In this survey, we aim to provide a systematic and comprehensive review of the contemporary deep learning techniques for graph anomaly detection. Specifically, we provide a taxonomy that follows a task-driven strategy and categorizes existing work according to the anomalous graph objects that they can detect. We especially focus on the challenges in this research area and discuss the key intuitions, technical details as well as relative strengths and weaknesses of various techniques in each category. From the survey results, we highlight 12 future research directions spanning unsolved and emerging problems introduced by graph data, anomaly detection, deep learning and real-world applications. Additionally, to provide a wealth of useful resources for future studies, we have compiled a set of open-source implementations, public datasets, and commonly-used evaluation metrics. With this survey, our goal is to create a 'one-stop-shop' that provides a unified understanding of the problem categories and existing approaches, publicly available hands-on resources, and high-impact open challenges for graph anomaly detection using deep learning.  © 1989-2012 IEEE.","Anomaly detection; deep learning; fake news detection; fraud detection; graph anomaly detection; graph embedding; graph neural networks; graph representation; misinformation; outlier detection; rumor detection; spammer detection","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117120759"

Researchers have proposed numerous SMOTE-based techniques (synthetic minority oversampling technique) in the area of oversampling to solve the imbalance issue in numerical data; meanwhile, less attention has been paid to the problem of imbalance in textual data. Consequently, given the importance of fake news detection due to their potential in deviating the flow of information, as well as their imbalanced textual structure, certain datasets related to fake news are employed in this study. In the proposed model, first the important features are extracted and textual features are converted into numerical vectors with fixed lengths to transform into compatible formats for machine learning algorithms. Then, a novel oversampling method called KNNGAN is used to balance the datasets and address a number of shortcomings present in the SMOTE model and its derivatives, which have also been overlooked in other inquiries. These models pay no attention to the location of samples and their nearest neighbors in the minority class. In such a case, small detached sets are disregarded and imbalance is raised in the minority class. On the other hand, the SMOTE model exclusively focuses on local information, resulting in a lack of diversity in synthetic sample generation. At first, the KNNGAN method divides the minority class into unsafe, boundary, and safe areas using a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm and a specified neighborhood radius. Next, after identifying noisy data and small detached sets, the model generates diverse synthetic samples in the minority class using a designed generative adversarial neural network (GAN). Synthetic samples can connect sparse areas to dense areas and therefore reduce imbalance in the minority class. The proposed model reduced the difficulty in the employed dataset by 13.25% (on average) and increased AUC by 11.5% (on average), when deep learning models were used. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Deep learning; Fake news; Feature extraction; Imbalanced data; Oversampling","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140067936"

Extensive experiments on two real datasets show that MLSED can fully capture the semantic information of news for fake news detection, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. © 2023 IEEE.","Deep learning; Fake news detection; Multimodal; Semantic enhancement","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169580378"

Fake news are spreading since decades, but with the rise of social media the nature of misinformation has evolved from text based modality to visual modalities, such as images, audio and video. Therefore, the identification of media-rich fake news requires an approach that exploits and effectively combines the information acquired from different multimodal categories. Multimodality is a key approach to improve fake news detection, but effective solutions supporting it are still poorly explored. More specifically, many different works exist that investigate if a text, an image or a video is fake or not, but effective research on a real multimodal setting, ‘fusing’ the different modalities with their different structure and dimension is still an open problem. The paper is a focused survey concerning a very specific topic that is the use of Deep Learning methods (DL) for multimodal fake news detection on social media. © 2023, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Fake News Detection; Multimodal; Social Media","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161496756"

However, this information is typically unverified and/or interpreted according to the point of view of the publisher. Consequently, malicious users can leverage these unofficial channels to share misleading or false news to manipulate the opinion of the readers and make fake news viral. In this scenario, early detection of this malicious information is challenging as it requires coping with several issues (e.g., scarcity of labelled data, unbalanced class distribution, and efficient handling of raw data). To address all these issues, in this work, we propose a Semi-Supervised Deep Learning based approach that allows for discovering accurate and effective Fake News Detection models. By embedding a BERT model in a pseudo-labelling procedure, the approach can yield reliable detection models also when a limited number of examples are available.

Although many theoretical outcomes have been produced in recent years, they are generally challenged by processing speed of semantic modeling. To solve this issue, this paper presents a deep learning-based fast fake news detection model for cyber-physical social services. Taking Chinese text as the objective, each character in Chinese text is directly adopted as the basic processing unit. Considering the fact that the news are generally short texts and can be remarkably featured by some keywords, convolution-based neural computing framework is adopted to extract feature representation for news texts. Such design is able to ensure both processing speed and detection ability in scenes of Chinese short texts. At last, some experiments are conducted for evaluation on a real-world dataset collected from a Chinese social media. The results show that the proposal possesses lower training time cost as well as higher classification accuracy compared with baseline methods. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","cyber-physical space; deep learning; fake news; fast detection; social service","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149329149"

The identification of false information, specifically in the Arabic dialect, presents inherent difficulties due to its diverse characteristics and linguistic intricacies. This study implements AutoKeras, a deep learning-based machine learning framework. Using advanced optimization techniques, the neural network architecture search, hyperparameter adjustments, and model selection can all be automated in AutoKeras. Therefore, it is suitable for our fake news detection task. The methodology employs proficient deep learning algorithms and natural language processing methods to acquire distinct characteristics that enable accurate differentiation between genuine and fake news. The present study uses various sources, including news websites, social media platforms, and blogs, to construct the dataset. The AutoKeras-based approach is superior to multiple state-of-the-art approaches to detecting fabricated news in Arabic, as evidenced by the experimental results.

If not detected and stopped in time, it is easy to cause public panic and social unrest. Therefore, exploring accurate and efficient fake news detection technology has high theoretical value and practical significance. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the related fake news detection techniques. Firstly, the relevant concepts of multi-modal fake news are sorted and summarized, and the trend of changes in single-modal and multi-modal news datasets is analyzed. Secondly, this paper introduces single-modal fake news detection techniques based on machine learning and deep learning, which have been widely used in the field of fake news detection. However, traditional single- modal techniques cannot fully explore the deep logic of fake news because fake news usually contains multiple data presentations. Thus, they are unable to effectively deal with the challenges brought by multi-modal fake news data. To address this issue, this paper summarizes and discusses advanced multi- modal fake news detection techniques from the perspectives of multi-stream and graph architectures, and explores their concepts and potential drawbacks.

Millions of articles are published daily in the press, on social media, and in electronic media, and many of them may be fake. It is common for scammers to spread fake news to mislead people for malicious purposes. For researchers to be able to evaluate fake news, it is necessary to understand its diversity, how to study it, how to detect it, and its limitations. A descriptive literature review has been conducted in this paper to identify more appropriate methodologies for analysing fake news. The review found two broad classifications in the fake news research methodologies: fake news study perspectives and fake news detection techniques. Based on our literature review, we suggest four perspectives to study fake news and two major approaches to detecting it. Fake news can be studied in terms of knowledge, style, propagation and source. In order to detect fake news, there are two major approaches: manually and automatically. There are two types of manual fact-checks: expert-based and crowd-sourced. Automatic techniques are based mainly on data science methods, specifically deep learning and machine learning. A machine learning-based method was found to be more appealing when we evaluated all the automatic methods. Further research will focus on investigating the efficacy of using Bayesian methods for detecting fake news statistically because it is a flexible approach that allows for rapid updating of models in response to new data and has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems across different domains.  © 2013 IEEE.","Bayesian modelling; classification; deep learning; fake news detection; machine learning; NLP","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164775431"

Using semantic analysis and several forms of machine learning, the authors of this research study provide an innovative method for identifying instances of false news. To describe the contextual semantics of textual data more precisely, we use Word Embeddings and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. From multiple internet sources, we gathered a dataset of real and false news stories, which we then preprocessed using tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and sequence padding. To capture the semantic links between words and phrases, we employed the Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) to convert each word into a dense vector representation. This was used to feed a stacked LSTM model, a kind of RNN that can recognise long-distance relationships in text data. Our suggested approach beat conventional models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and LSTM without Word Embeddings during rigorous testing. Our method achieved an accuracy of 0.92, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LSTM networks with Word Embeddings for fake news detection. Despite these promising results, challenges related to language generalization, sensitivity to word embedding quality, and inclusion of additional sources of information remain. Our research signifies a key contribution to the ongoing fight against fake news and disinformation, providing an effective approach to detect fake news with potential for further enhancement and application in real-world scenarios. Future work could focus on fine-tuning the model for different languages and domains, improving word embeddings, and integrating additional information sources to further improve fake news detection. © 2023 IEEE.","Deep learning; Fake news detection; LSTM; Semantic analysis; Word Embeddings","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179836886"

The change of media media makes false news gradually change from text form to multi-modal form with graphic and text coexisting. Multimodal fake news carries heterogeneous forms of text and image information, and research on the multimodal content of fake news can improve the effect of fake news detection. Existing multimodal fake news detection methods have the following deficiencies. First of all, in terms of feature extraction, most methods do not consider their own effective features, and features are not universal at this stage. Secondly, in terms of feature fusion, in the previous fake news detection methods that used image features combined with text features, the feature information in the news was simply spliced, without considering the interactive information between the two modalities. Finally, in terms of model structure, few models can verify the effectiveness of extracted features.

A hybrid HyproBert model for automatic fake news detection is proposed in this paper. To begin, the proposed HyproBert model uses DistilBERT for tokenization and word embeddings. The embeddings are provided as input to the convolution layer to highlight and extract the spatial features. Subsequently, the output is provided to BiGRU to extract the contextual features. The CapsNet, along with the self-attention layer, proceeds to the output of BiGRU to model the hierarchy relationship among the spatial features. Finally, a dense layer is implemented to combine all the features for classification. The proposed HyproBert model is evaluated using two fake news datasets (ISOT and FA-KES).

Currently, partly due to the COVID-19 virus outbreak and the subsequent proliferation of unfounded claims and highly biased content, attention has focused on developing solutions that can automatically assess the genuineness of health information. Most of these approaches, applied both to Web pages and social media content, rely primarily on the use of handcrafted features in conjunction with Machine Learning. In this article, instead, we propose a health misinformation detection model that exploits as features the embedded representations of some structural and content characteristics of Web pages, which are obtained using an embedding model pre-trained on medical data.

Some early studies use news content to detect fake news. As content feature-based methods lack generalizability for fake news detection, researchers explored methods that use social context features of news. However, existing studies only use single-feature (either propagation or structure) detection, but none uses diffusion group information (e.g., the group with the most user responses in the news events) in detecting fake news. Thus, this research develops a fake news detection framework named MDG, which learns and integrates the maximal diffusion feature with the deep propagation and global structure features. To validate the performance of our framework, two sets of experiments are designed on three publicly available datasets, i.e., Twitter15, Twitter16, and Weibo. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and F1-macro performance. Moreover, our framework is especially suitable for multi-lingual fake news detection. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; Deep propagation feature; Fake news detection; Global structure feature; Maximal diffusion feature; Social media","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145583561"

These types of structures include phrase dependency trees and image scene graphs. Graph reasoning models are used for this kind of investigation. GNNs have the ability to express the dependence of a graph via the use of message forwarding between graph nodes.

Although the digitalization progress of the media brings many advantages, it also increases the risk of spreading disinformation, misinformation, and malformation through the use of fake news. The emergence of this harmful phenomenon has managed to polarize society and manipulate public opinion on particular topics, e.g., elections, vaccinations, etc. Such information propagated on social media can distort public perceptions and generate social unrest while lacking the rigor of traditional journalism. Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques are essential for developing efficient tools that can detect fake news. Models that use the context of textual data are essential for resolving the fake news detection problem, as they manage to encode linguistic features within the vector representation of words. In this paper, we propose a new approach that uses document embeddings to build multiple models that accurately label news articles as reliable or fake. We also present a benchmark on different architectures that detect fake news using binary or multi-labeled classification. We evaluated the models on five large news corpora using accuracy, precision, and recall. We obtained better results than more complex state-of-the-art Deep Neural Network models. We observe that the most important factor for obtaining high accuracy is the document encoding, not the classification model's complexity. © 2023 by the authors.","classification models; deep learning; document embeddings; fake news detection; machine learning; text analysis","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147883520"

Fake news has far-reaching consequences, influencing public opinion, disrupting democracy, fueling social tensions, and impacting various domains such as health, environment, and the economy. In order to identify fake news with data sparsity especially with low resources languages such as Arabic and its dialects, we propose a few-shot learning fake news detection model based on sentence transformer fine tuning, utilizing no crafted prompts and language model with few parameters. The experimental results prove that the proposed method can achieve higher performances with fewer news samples. This approach provided 71% F1 score on the Algerian dialect fake news dataset and 70% F1 score on the Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) version of the same dataset, which prove that the approach can work on the standard Arabic and its dialects. Therefore, the proposed model can identify fake news in several domains concerning the Algerian community such as politics, COVID-19, tourism, ecommerce, sport, accidents and cars prices. © IBERAMIA and the authors.","Algerian Dialect; Arabic; BERT; Deep Learning; Fake News; Few-Shot Learning; MSA; Normalization; Social Media","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173473544"

Knowing the integrity of information has been a long-standing problem, even more so for the regional languages. Regional languages, such as Hindi, raise challenging problems for fake news detection as they tend to be resource constrained. This limits the amount of data available to efficiently train models for these languages. Most of the existing techniques to detect fake news is targeted towards the English language or involves the manual translation of the language to the English language and then proceeding with Deep Learning methods. Pre-trained transformer based models such as BERT are fine-tuned for the task of fake news detection and are commonly employed for detecting fake news. Other pre-trained transformer models, such as ELECTRA and RoBERTa have also been shown to be able to detect fake news in multiple languages after suitable fine-tuning. In this work, we propose a method for detecting fake news in resource constrained languages such as Hindi more efficiently by using an ensemble of pre-trained transformer models, all of which are individually fine-tuned for the task of fake news detection. We demonstrate that the use of such a transformer ensemble consisting of XLM-RoBERTa, mBERT and ELECTRA is able to improve the efficiency of fake news detection in Hindi by overcoming the drawbacks of individual transformer models. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","ELECTRA; Ensemble; Fake news; Hindi fake news; mBERT; Transformer; XLM-RoBERTa","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145651953"

To address this problem, this research proposes additional characteristics based on social interactions and content to identify fake news on social media platforms. These characteristics are designed to work in conjunction with each other and are found to be more effective in identifying fake news compared to the current baseline criteria. In addition, a CNN-LSTM model is used to analyze the text and predict the veracity of news.

Moreover, the number of labeled datasets is limited, humans are not particularly reliable labelers and databases are mostly in English and focused on political news. To solve these issues state-of-the-art machine learning models have been used to automatically identify fake news. However, the high amount of models and the heterogeneity of features used in literature often represents a boundary for researchers trying to improve model performances. For this reason, in this systematic review, a taxonomy of machine learning and deep learning models and features adopted in Content-Based Fake News Detection is proposed and their performance is compared over the analysed works.

This permits the very quick spread of fake news globally and misleads the people against democracy and freedom. The content of fake news very closely resembles true news. So, technically, it is tough for a deep neural network to ‘detect and attend to’ the ‘fake only’ aspects of a news article. Fake news detection is a significantly complex and challenging task from the aspect of deep learning-based attention mechanisms. The deep learning-based fake news detection systems suffer from indistinguishability of fake and real news/data, the curse of high dimensionality, the high training time of deep neural networks, the over-fitting of the network training, and the over-thinking problem. In this paper, a shallow-based convolution neural networks (SCNN) model has been proposed for the fake news detection system to overcome the mentioned issues.

From the available literature, most studies focused on fake news detection and identification and fake news sentiment analysis using machine learning or deep learning techniques. However, relatively few researchers have paid attention to fake news analysis. This is especially true for fake political news. Unlike other published works which built fake news detection models from computer scientists’ viewpoints, this study aims to develop an effective method that combines natural language processing (NLP) and latent semantic analysis (LSA) using singular value decomposition (SVD) techniques to help social scientists to analyze fake news for discovering the exact elements. In addition, the authors analyze the characteristics of true news and fake news. A real case from the USA election campaign in 2016 is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. The experimental results could give useful suggestions to future researchers to distinguish fake news. This study finds the five concepts extracted from LSA and that they are representative of political fake news during the election. © 2023 by the authors.","fake news; latent semantic analysis; natural language processing; online news; social media","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163726709"

Fake news recognition intends to assist users to divulge various fake news. Fake news on several vaccinations, medicines, and foods concerning the COVID19 pandemic has augmented intensely. Such fake news reports make people trust false and harmful stories and claims, and they even affect the vaccination opinions of people. Immediate detection of COVID19 fake news may assist to decrease the spread of confusion fear, and health risks among residents. Text mining related data analytics techniques are employed to detect COVID19 based fake news on social networking sites. This article introduces an African Vulture Optimization with Deep Learning based COVID-19 Fake News Detection (AVODL-FND) method. The goal of the AVODL-FND model lies in the identification of fake news relevant to COVID19 circulated in social media. In the presented AVODL-FND method, the initial stage of data preprocessing is carried out in three distinct levels to transform the input data into a useful format. The presented AVODL-FND model applies multi-head attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory (MHA-BLSTM) approach for the detection of fake news. For enhancing the detection performance of the MHA-BLSTM model, the AVO algorithm is utilized for the hyperparameter tuning process. The experimental outcomes of the AVODL-FND model on the fake news dataset show the significant performance of the AVODL-FND model over other DL methods.  © 2023 IEEE.","African vulture optimization; Data analytics; Deep learning; Fake news detection; Social media; Text mining","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182525515"

A good fake news detection system is essential because the news readers receive can affect their opinions. Several works on fake news detection have been done using machine learning and deep learning approaches. Recently, the deep learning approach has been preferred over machine learning because of its ability to comprehend the intricacies of textual data. The introduction of transformer architecture changed the NLP paradigm and distinguished itself from recurrent models by enabling the processing of sentences as a whole rather than word by word. The attention mechanisms introduced in Transformers allowed them to understand the relationship between far-apart tokens in a sentence. Numerous deep learning works on fake news detection have been published by focusing on different features to determine the authenticity of a news source. We performed an extensive analysis of the comprehensive NELA-GT 2020 dataset, which revealed that the title and content of a news source contain discernible information critical for determining its integrity. To this objective, we introduce 'FakeNews Transformer' - a specialized Transformer-based architecture that considers the news story's title and content to assess its veracity. Our proposed work achieved an accuracy of 74.0% on a subset of the NELA-GT 2020 dataset. To our knowledge, FakeNews Transformer is the first published work that considers both title and content for evaluating a news article; thus, we compare the performance of our work against two BERT and two LSTM models working independently on title and content. Our work outperformed the BERT and LSTM models working independently on title by 7.6% and 9.6%, while performing better than the BERT and LSTM models working independently on content by 8.9% and 10.5%, respectively.  © 2023 - IOS Press.

However, this occasionally results in the propagation of erroneous information, which may be difficult to distinguish from the truth. The widespread diffusion of such information can result in irrational and poor decision making on potentially important issues. In 2020, this coincided with the global outbreak of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), a highly contagious and deadly virus. The proliferation of misinformation about COVID-19 on social media has already been identified as an ""infodemic""by the World Health Organization (WHO), posing significant challenges for global governments seeking to manage the pandemic. This has driven an urgent need for methods to automatically detect and identify such misinformation. The research uses multiple deep learning model frameworks to detect misinformation in Chinese and English, and compare them based on different text feature selections. The model learns the textual characteristics of each type of true and misinformation for subsequent true/false prediction.

A very common social media platform with the highest rapidly increasing number of users in the Middle East is Twitter. However, along with an increase in the number of Twitter users has come an increase in the amount fake news being spread across the platform. This, in turn, has caught the attention of researchers who seek nothing more than an online experience free of fake news. As are result, through utilizing both the transformer-based language and recurrent neural network models, this paper introduces an intelligent classification model that identifies fake news presented in Arabic tweets. Afterwards, this research presents a comparative study between deep learning and shallow learning. In Addition, to enhance the effectiveness of the proposed model, researchers also built an Arabic Twitter dataset that included 206, 080 tweets. Results have shown that pre-trained deep learning models performed much better than shallow models when it came to identifying fake news in Arabic.

With the increasing popularity of news consumption on various social media platforms, there has been a surge of misinformation which includes false information or unfounded claims. As various text- and social context-based fake news detectors are proposed to detect misinformation on social media, recent works start to focus on the vulnerabilities of fake news detectors. In this paper, we present the first adversarial attack framework against Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based fake news detectors to probe their robustness. Specifically, we leverage a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to simulate the adversarial behavior of fraudsters on social media. Research has shown that in real-world settings, fraudsters coordinate with each other to share different news in order to evade the detection of fake news detectors. Therefore, we modeled our MARL framework as a Markov Game with bot, cyborg, and crowd worker agents, which have their own distinctive cost, budget, and influence. We then use deep Q-learning to search for the optimal policy that maximizes the rewards. Extensive experimental results on two real-world fake news propagation datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework can effectively sabotage the GNN-based fake news detector performance.

This paper focuses on fake news detection as a text classification problem: on the basis of five publicly available corpora with documents labeled as true or fake, the task was to automatically distinguish both classes without relying on fact-checking. The aim of our research was to test the feasibility of a universal model: one that produces satisfactory results on all data sets tested in our article. We attempted to do so by training a set of classification models on one collection and testing them on another. As it turned out, this resulted in a sharp performance degradation. Therefore, this paper focuses on finding the most effective approach to utilizing information in a transferable manner. We examined a variety of methods: feature selection, machine learning approaches to data set shift (instance re-weighting and projection-based), and deep learning approaches based on domain transfer. These methods were applied to various feature spaces: linguistic and psycholinguistic, embeddings obtained from the Universal Sentence Encoder, and GloVe embeddings. A detailed analysis showed that some combinations of these methods and selected feature spaces bring significant improvements. When using linguistic data, feature selection yielded the best overall mean improvement (across all train-test pairs) of 4%.

In the literature, existing multimodal fake news detection models usually learn the cross-modal semantic correlations across news image and text from a global perspective, and utilize their shared information to infer the key clues for detection. Although such approaches are able to detect the obvious multimodal fake news, these global modeling methods cannot well differentiate the local semantic differences within the news and therefore may degrade the detection performance. Indeed, the unshared semantic content serves as an important clue that can directly reveal their tampering intentions and purposes. Inspired by these findings, this paper proposes a multimodal fake news detection model based on two-branch deep clue perception and adaptive collaborative optimization, which can well mine the non-shared semantic clues for efficient detections. Specifically, the model first extracts fine-grained features from image salient regions and text semantic words to capture the semantic news content. Then, the heterogeneous news features are semantically aligned using a crossmodal weighted residual network, featuring on learning the shared semantic clues. For deep inference of non-shared semantic clues, the model designs an adaptive two-branch clue perception strategy to learn the cross-modal semantic correlations within the multimodal news. Specifically, the model automatically constructs an image-text clue correlation matrix based on all image regions and text words. Accordingly, a two-branch clue perception module is explicitly designed to model the probability distributions for shared and non-shared semantic correlations of all content in the matrix. On the one hand, the clue correlation optimization branch embeds an optimization algorithm to continuously update the semantic correlation boundaries of the different semantic correlation distributions iteratively, whereby the non-shared semantic clues can be well differentiated from the clue correlation matrix. On the other hand, the clue correlation analysis branch portrays the credibility of the different news content and guides the model to achieve automatic multimodal feature fusion on the basis of the correlation scores. Finally, the learning framework can well generates the non-shared semantic clue features by aggregating the optimized image-text clues. With the above adaptive co-optimization framework, the proposed model is capable of mining the deep clues to achieve more accurate and interpretable multimodal fake news detection. Experimental results on public English and Chinese datasets show that the proposed detection model significantly outperforms the baseline methods, with an average improvement of 4.85% and 4.50%, respectively, in accuracy and fake news detection precision. © 2023 Science Press.

However, these methods typically ignore textual content in images and fail to explore the relationship between news and image texts further. We propose a new fake news detection method based on correlation extension multimodal (CEMM) information to solve this problem. The correlation between multimodal information is extended and the relationship between the extended image information and the news text is explored further by extracting text and statistical features from the image.

This research study explores fake news classification using diverse ML and DL approaches. We utilized a well-known “Fake News” dataset sourced from Kaggle, encompassing a labelled news collection. We implemented diverse ML models, including multinomial naïve bayes (MNB), gaussian naïve bayes (GNB), Bernoulli naïve Bayes (BNB), logistic regression (LR), and passive aggressive classifier (PAC).

In particular, humans are faced with the fact that, often, the opinion of an expert is as important and significant as the opinion of a non-expert. It is possible to observe changes and processes in traditional media that reduce the role of a conventional ‘editorial office’, placing gradual emphasis on the remote work of journalists and forcing increasingly frequent use of online sources rather than actual reporting work. As a result, social media has become an element of state security, as disinformation and fake news produced by malicious actors can manipulate readers, creating unnecessary debate on topics organically irrelevant to society. This causes a cascading effect, fear of citizens, and eventually threats to the state’s security. Advanced data sensors and deep machine learning methods have great potential to enable the creation of effective tools for combating the fake news problem. However, these solutions often need better model generalization in the real world due to data deficits.

For an informed and reliable information ecosystem to continue to exist, the ability to identify fake news in various languages is essential. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based model for Bangla fake news detection using DistilBERT, a distilled variant of the BERT model. We begin by curating a large-scale dataset of Bangla news articles, comprising both authentic and fake news samples. To capture the contextual information and semantic relationships within the Bangla language, we fine-tune the DistilBERT model on this dataset. The pre-training process entails putting the model through its paces on a sizable corpus of Bangla text data. We compare its performance with that of other standard machine learning and deep learning models, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) in order to show that our model is superior at correctly identifying fake news in Bangla. The experimental findings show that the suggested model performs competitively in detecting Bangla fake news, surpassing other approaches with 97.85% accuracy.  © 2023 IEEE.","bangla fake news detection; deep learning; DistilBERT; machine learning; natural language processing","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190294196"

Thus, the need for automated fake news detection is more important than ever. In this work, we investigated the interplay between news content and users’ posting behavior clues in detecting fake news by using state-of-the-art deep learning approaches, such as the convolutional neural network (CNN), which involves a series of filters of different sizes and shapes (combining the original sentence matrix to create further low-dimensional matrices), and the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU), which is a type of bidirectional recurrent neural network with only the input and forget gates, coupled with a self-attention mechanism. The proposed architectures introduced a novel approach to learning rich, semantical, and contextual representations of a given news text using natural language understanding of transfer learning coupled with context-based features. Experiments were conducted on the FakeNewsNet dataset. The experimental results show that incorporating information about users’ posting behaviors (when available) improves the performance compared to models that rely solely on textual news data. © 2023 by the authors.","BERT; deep learning; fake news; misinformation","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149940032"

However, when false but appealing information is presented as news, it becomes a cause for serious concern as it might lead to a harmful influence on communities of innocent believers. To address this issue, we propose I-FLASH, an interpretable fake news detector that not only detects fake news but also explains why it considers some content fake or genuine. Moreover, recent research evaluated their models for fake news detection on domain-specific datasets. Therefore, in this paper, two new tiny datasets, FactCheck and FactCheck2, were culled from the official Twitter accounts/websites of various well-known media outlets, covering a variety of other societal domains such as education, crime, and technology. We also compared the performance of the machine learning model (logistic regression with TF-IDF), deep learning model (bidirectional LSTM with GloVe word embeddings), and the pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model on curated datasets along with two other popular datasets, namely, LIAR and COVID-19. The stratified 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of 94.41 ± 0.38% on the COVID-19 dataset, 61.18 ± 0.55% on the LIAR dataset, 87.25 ± 2.45% on FactCheck, and 92.91 ± 2.07% on FactCheck2, attained at 95% confidence interval, establishes the efficacy of models. On cross-dataset validation, we observe that the model trained on a generalized dataset like FactCheck2 can perform well on domain-specific datasets like COVID-19 and LIAR with a validation accuracy of 64.25% and 54.22%, respectively.

Fake news, in particular, spreads more rapidly and is produced at a lower cost compared to genuine news. While researchers have developed various methods for the automated detection of fake news, challenges such as the presence of multimodal information in news articles or insufficient multimodal data have hindered their detection efficacy. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel multimodal fusion model (TLFND) based on a three-level feature matching distance approach for fake news detection. TLFND comprises four core components: a two-level text feature extraction module, an image extraction and fusion module, a three-level feature matching score module, and a multimodal integrated recognition module. This model seamlessly combines two levels of text information (headline and body) and image data (multi-image fusion) within news articles. Notably, we introduce the Chebyshev distance metric for the first time to calculate matching scores among these three modalities. Additionally, we design an adaptive evolutionary algorithm for computing the loss functions of the four model components. Our comprehensive experiments on three real-world publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed model, with remarkable improvements demonstrated across all four evaluation metrics for the PolitiFact, GossipCop, and Twitter datasets, resulting in an F1 score increase of 6.6%, 2.9%, and 2.3%, respectively. © 2023 by the authors.","deep learning; fake news detection; matching distance; multimodal integrated detection","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177681975"

It spreads faster than real news and produces a slew of issues, including disinformation, misunderstanding, and misdirection in the minds of readers. To combat the spread of fake news, detection algorithms are used, which examine news articles through temporal language processing. The lack of human engagement during fake news detection is the main problem with these systems. To address this problem, this paper presents a cooperative deep learning-based fake news detection model.The suggested technique uses user feedbacks to estimate news trust levels, and news ranking is determined based on these values. Lower-ranked news is preserved for language processing to ensure its validity, while higher-ranked content is recognized as genuine news. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is utilized to turn user feedback into rankings in the deep learning layer. Negatively rated news is sent back into the system to train the CNN model. The suggested model is found to have a 98% accuracy rate for detecting fake news, which is greater than most existing language processing based models.The suggested deep learning cooperative model is also compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, and area under the curve (AUC). Based on this analysis, the suggested model is found to be highly efficient. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Convolutional; Cooperative; Deep learning; Fake news; Language processing; Social media","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149043361"

Most existing deep learning methods focus on mining news text content, user information, and propagation features but ignore the rumor diffusion structural features. Rumors spread in a vertical chain and diffusion in a horizontal network. Both are essential features of rumors. In addition, existing models need more effective methods to extract higher-order features of multiple resource information. To address these problems, we propose a multi-source information heterogeneous graph model in this paper, called jointly Multi-Source information and Local-Global relationship of heterogeneous network model named MSLG. It extracts multi-source information such as rumors content, user information, propagation, and diffusion structure. Firstly, we extract the higher order semantic representation of rumors content by graph convolution network and integrate local relational attention to strengthen the critical semantic. At the same time, we construct the rumors and users as heterogeneous graphs to capture the propagation and diffusion structure of the rumors. We are finally fusing global relational attention to measure submodules’ importance. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in fake news detection.

This coincides with the increased likelihood that users will acquire their news from websites and social media platforms. While there has been various research into the detection of fake news in text using machine learning techniques, less attention has been paid to the problem of multimedia data fabrication. In this paper, we propose a Stylometric, and Semantic similarity oriented for Multimodal Fake News Detection (SSM). There are five distinct modules that make up our methodology: Firstly, we used a Hyperbolic Hierarchical Attention Network (Hype-HAN) for extracting stylometric textual features. Secondly, we generated the news content summary and computed the similarity between Headline and summary. Thirdly, semantic similarity is computed between visual and textual features. Fourthly, images are analyzed for forgery. Lastly, the extracted features are fused for final classification. We have tested SSM framework on three standard fake news datasets. The results indicated that our suggested model has outperformed the base line and state-of-the-art methods and is more likely to detect fake news in complex environments. © 2023 The Author(s)","Deep learning; Fake news detection; Mulltimodal; Natural language processing; Semantic features; Stylometric features","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85154022046"

One of the crucial is-sues in this domain is the inherent class imbalance, where genuine news articles significantly outnumber fake ones. This imbalance severely hampers the performance of machine and deep learning models in accurately identifying fake news. Consequently, there is a compelling need to address this problem effectively. In this study, we delve into fake news detection and tackle the critical issue of imbalanced data. We investigate the application of Easy Data Augmentation (EDA) techniques, including back-translation, random insertion, random deletion, and random swap to mitigate the adverse effects of imbalanced data. This study focuses on employing these techniques in conjunction with a deep learning framework, specifically a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) architecture. The results of the EDA techniques will be systematically compared to see their effectiveness and their impacts on model performance. This study reveals that various EDA techniques, when coupled with a BiLSTM architecture, yield significant improvements in fake news detection. Among the experiments, it shows that Random Insertion, with an impressive accuracy rate of 81.68%, a precision score of 89.38%, and an F1-Score of 87.77% emerges as the most promising technique. The study also highlights the exceptional potential of Back-translation stands out with an 87.16% recall performance.  © 2023 IEEE.","Bidirectional LSTM; Deep Learning; Easy data augmentation; Fake news detection; Imbalanced data","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191306182"

Fake news are spreading for decades, but with the rise of social media, the nature of misinformation has evolved from text-based modality to visual modalities, such as images, audio, and video. Therefore, the identification of media-rich fake news requires an approach that exploits and effectively combines the information acquired from different multimodal categories. Multimodality is a key approach to improving fake news detection, but effective solutions supporting it are still poorly explored. More specifically, many different works exist that investigate if a text, an image, or a video is fake or not, but effective research on a real multimodal setting, ‘fusing’ the different modalities with their different structure and dimension is still an open problem. The paper is a focused survey concerning a very specific topic which is the use of deep learning (DL) methods for multimodal fake news detection on social media. The survey provides, for each work surveyed, a description of some relevant features such as the DL method used, the type of analysed data, and the fusion strategy adopted.

As social networks gradually presents a multimodal property, many scholars have devoted to multimodal fake news detection. However, the current multimodal achievements mainly focus on the fusion modeling between texts and images, while their consistencies are still in their infancy. This paper concentrates on the issue of how to extract effective features from texts and images, how to match modes in a more precise way, and subsequently proposes a novel fake news detection method. Especially, the models of Bert, Vgg, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) are respectively adopted to reflect the textual features, the visual counterparts, as well as the corresponding embedded contents in the attachment. The overall model framework consists of four components: one fusion module and three matching modules, where the former one joints text and image features, and the latter three computes the corresponding similarities among textual, visual, and auxiliary modalities. Aligning them with different weights, and connecting them with a classifier, whether the news is fake or real can thus emerge. Comparative experiments embody the effectiveness of our model, which can reach 88.1%’s accuracy on the Chinese Weibo dataset and 91.7%’s accuracy on the English Twitter dataset. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","feature extraction; feature fusion; feature matching; multimodal fake news detection","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174568492"

However, OSNs are a double-edged sword. Although the great advantages they offer such as unlimited easy communication and instant news and information, they can also have many disadvantages and issues. One of their major challenging issues is the spread of fake news. Fake news identification is still a complex unresolved issue. Furthermore, fake news detection on OSNs presents unique characteristics and challenges that make finding a solution anything but trivial. On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are still incapable of overcoming this challenging problem. To make matters worse, AI techniques such as machine learning and deep learning are leveraged to deceive people by creating and disseminating fake content. Consequently, automatic fake news detection remains a huge challenge, primarily because the content is designed in a way to closely resemble the truth, and it is often hard to determine its veracity by AI alone without additional information from third parties. This work aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of fake news research as well as a fundamental review of existing approaches used to detect and prevent fake news from spreading via OSNs.

Existing fake news detection is based on style analysis or news generator's behavior analysis, the former fails if the content is generated using existing news corpus while the latter requires a very specific data set. In this research, we aim to address the issue of fake news detection by employing deep learning-based time series analysis (TSA). We propose a TSA method to gauge the authenticity of the news based on previously available news content of a similar genre. We employed pre-trained models for encoding including GloVe and BERT and transformer-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) for TSA. The results demonstrate 98% accuracy of pre-trained models, such as GloVe and BERT, over traditional encoding approaches having accuracy between 77% and 93%. Our study also compares the effectiveness of various deep learning methods, including Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), LSTM with attention, GRU with attention, and Transformers with 8 and 16 multi-heads. The results show that Transformers with 8 and 16 multi-heads achieve 98% and 97% accuracy respectively as compared to LSTM (87%) and GRU (88%).

However, information present on social media is sometimes incorrect, unverified, or misleading. Such information is often termed fake news. It is deliberately written to deceive the readers. It has the potential to change their perception of the topic or content being discussed. The best medium to share fake news is social media platforms. Large amounts of misleading or fake online information can have serious consequences. It can affect the social, political, economic well-being of individuals, society, and a nation as a whole. Fake News in the form of satire, fabricated and manipulated content, misleading information, and conspiracy theories get more likes and shares on social media and they spread quickly in no time. Thus, fake news detection (FND) and prevention on social media platforms have gained tremendous attention among researchers. Fake news through online platforms poses unique challenges. Firstly, it is written intentionally and is subjective, making it very difficult to authenticate it based on news content. Secondly, social media information is unstructured and multi-modal, both aspects are complex to capture and integrate in fake news detection. Thirdly, fake information spreads very quickly and is mainly circulated through bots, trolls, and humans from varied backgrounds. Identifying such spreaders and victims is a challenging task. This article presents a critical review of the literature on fake news detection. The state-of-the-art methods are discussed, most of the methods depend on news contents, user profiles, and social context features of a post. The importance of feature engineering, feature extraction and feature fusion in FND are highlighted. Various fake news detection datasets are discussed.

Intelligent methods used to control this fake news in various languages have already been much discussed and frequently proposed by researchers. However, Arabic grammar and language are a far more complex and crucial language to learn. Therefore, work on Arabic fake-news-based datasets and related studies is much needed to control the spread of fake news on social media and other Internet media. The current study uses a recently published dataset of Arabic fake news annotated by experts. Further, Arabic-language-based embeddings are given to machine learning (ML) classifiers, and the Arabic-language-based trained minibidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) is used to obtain the sentiments of Arabic grammar and feed a deep learning (DL) classifier. The holdout validation schemes are applied to both ML classifiers and mini-BERT-based deep neural classifiers.

In addition, various information can be quickly obtained on social media. However, not all information conveyed on social media is in accordance with factual conditions so it can mislead readers. Therefore, we need a system that can detect news that contains disinformation. Machine learning and deep learning can be used to detect and classify news containing disinformation. In this study, Hybrid classification is used on Twitter datasets related to political news in Indonesia, namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), with Support Vector Machine (SVM). With pre-Trained Word2Vec that changes words into numerical vectors, the hybrid model will extract and learn the features. The hybrid model is compared with the individual LSTM or CNN to see the best outcome given by those methods. The comparison is based on the SVM and Sigmoid classification results. The results of the study show that the proposed hybrid model, namely the CNN-LSTM-SVM, shows a better result than any other single model, which gives the hybrid model with 82.55% average score in 5-fold and the other hand, the LSTM-CNN-SVM model gives 82.20% average score which has a slight difference on the first hybrid model.  © 2023 IEEE.","deep learning; fake news; hybrid method; twitter","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175655522"

Although this task is far to be solved. Fake news detection is intrinsically hard since we have to cope with textual data; moreover the early detection requirement, to prevent wide diffusion, makes things even harder.

Its massive growth has given evolution to fake news in misinformation and rumors, spreading very quickly. These days the generation of fake news is not only limited to the traditional method but is also extended to deep learning-based methods. The characteristics of fake news generated from these algorithms are very much identical to original news, which makes existing supervised machine learning algorithms difficult to detect these machine-generated fake news. Motivated by the problem, we have brought a fully unsupervised approach based on Autoencoder and GAN. With the help of an autoencoder, we have generated the high dimensional feature vector of news sentences which is later used by generators in GAN to create machine-generated fake news. The generated fake news is then identified with the real news with the help of a discriminator. We have tested our approach with the news dataset that contains about 30,000 news headlines. The obtained experimental results suggest that our approach is very reliable and can be very helpful in automating fake news detection. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Autoencoders; Fake news detection; Fake news generation; Generative adversarial networks","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149644033"

Automated and trustworthy fact-checking methods are required because there is currently no established pipeline for validating all multi-media posts on social media. Reusing photographs from earlier events and incorporating expert editing and manipulation is a significant problem that helps fake news to appear real. Many earlier methods make use of unimodal machine learning techniques to identify out-of-context indications, but this strategy isn't reliable for assertions based on picture alterations in news. We put forth a thresholding-based CLIP approach to solve cross-modal ambiguity, with the goal of achieving a more precise categorisation by formally assessing the correlation between the texts and pictures of the targeted postings.

The theory behind the proposed model is to extract and combine global, spatial, and temporal features of text to use in a new fast classifier. The proposed model consists of two phases: first, global features are extracted by TF-IDF, spatial features by a convolutional neural network (CNN), and temporal features by bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) simultaneously. Then a fast learning network (FLN) is used to efficiently classify the features. Extensive experiments were conducted using two publicly available fake news datasets: ISOT and FA-KES. These two have different sizes; therefore, the proposed architecture (CNN+BiLSTM+FLN) can be evaluated much better. Results demonstrate the proposed model's superiority in comparison with previous works.  © 2013 IEEE.","bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM); convolutional neural network (CNN); distinguishing real and fake news; Fake news; fast learning network (FLN); global; novel architecture: CNN+BiLSTM+FLN; social media platforms; spatial features; temporal","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179787207"

The rise of social media usage to an extent is in favour of fake/false news promotion. A strong solution in this area would have numerous advantages for the society as a whole. Various deep learning techniques have been suggested by researchers to address this issue. But the majority of them don't identify false news with the requisite precision. In this paper, we propose a fake news identification model with state of art accuracy. Along with that, we compare different deep learning models in combination with different word embedding techniques for the task of fake news detection. Two types of word embeddings, Glove and Word2Vec were used for converting text to a vector of numbers. Along with the word embedding techniques we used seven different combinations of deep learning models: RNN, LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, GRU, Bi-directional GRU, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-Bi-directional LSTM. The proposed work also implemented FastText and BERT models for embedding and classification of false news. We discovered that the proposed BERT classification model performed most effectively for detecting fake news on the experimented dataset. The proposed BERT model outperformed various baseline models on the benchmark dataset, attaining a test data accuracy of 99.20%, establishing its state-of-the-art performance. For the evaluation of models, we used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics on the test data. © 2023 IEEE.","Binary Classification; Deep Learning; Embedding; Fake News Identification; Natural Language Processing; Social Media News","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179841468"

Misinformation and disinformation are mainly prevalent at the time some important event is happening that people are curious about e.g., elections or something untoward happens like the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the unprecedented nature of these events, people are susceptible to these bogus and potentially hazardous claims and articles. Therefore, we need an early detection mechanism to stop the spread of intentionally and unintentionally written fake news or claims. Past research has suggested various models based on machine learning, deep learning and pretrained language models to detect false news over the years. This research piece will try to assess the effectiveness of various relevant methods on the task of detecting fake news and false claims related to COVID-19 pandemic in this research. We will be using the combined corpus of two largest datasets available. We explore various pertained language models in addition to deep learning and conventional machine learning approaches and compare their performance. We find that RoBERTa in particular and Bert-based models in general outperform all other models. We believe this piece of research will help the research community a lot in exploring the said domain further. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","COVID-19; fake news detection; language models; machine learning; misinformation; social media fake news","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164917917"

Current methods are often fully supervised and typically employ deep neural networks (DNN) to learn implicit relevance from labeled data, ignoring explicitly shared properties (e.g., inflammatory expressions) across fake news. To address this limitation, we propose a graph-theoretic framework, called Generalized Deep Markov Random Fields Framework (GDMRFF), that inherits the capability of deep learning while at the same time exploiting the correlations among the news articles (including labeled and unlabeled data). Specifically, we first leverage a DNN-based module to learn implicit relations, which we then reveal as the unary function of MRF. Pairwise functions with refining effects to encapsulate human insights are designed to capture the explicit association among all samples. Meanwhile, an event removal module is introduced to remove event impact on pairwise functions. Note that we train GDMRFF with the semi-supervised setting, which decreases the reliance on labeled data while maximizing the potential of unlabeled data. We further develop an Ambiguity Learning Guided MRF (ALGM) model as a concretization of GDMRFF. Experiments show that ALGM outperforms the compared methods significantly on two datasets, especially when labeled data is limited. © 2023 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

One such approach is the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) to trace and analyze false information dissemination. GNNs are specialized DL model capable of processing graph-structured data, making them ideal for capturing intricate dependencies and relationships in the spread of fake news. Proposed implementation starting with data preparation, where a carefully curated dataset is essential. The news stories are processed, tokenized, and transformed into a graph representation to better understand the relationships between words or entities. Graph construction enables the formulation of ML problems as graph classification tasks. Graph embedding, achieved through methods like word2vec or GNNs, plays a crucial role in representing each node as a low-dimensional vector, capturing its semantic significance within the network. This technique facilitates ML activities, such as node classification and link prediction. Combining graph embeddings and GNNs for classification allows for a more precise identification of true and false news, considering the structure and content of news propagation graphs. Finally, evaluating false news detection involves performance metrics such as accuracy. Proposed implementation obtained detection accuracy of 94%. Striking a balance between minimizing false positives and false negatives is crucial to combat misinformation effectively.

Such texts are generated in a natural communicative setting. The explosion of social media permitted individuals to spread data with minimal examination and filters freely. Due to this, the old problem of fake news has resurfaced. It has become an important concern due to its negative impact on the community. To manage the spread of fake news, automatic recognition approaches have been investigated earlier using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. To perform the medicinal text classification tasks, the ML approaches were applied, and they performed quite effectively. Still, a huge effort is required from the human side to generate the labelled training data. The recent progress of the Deep Learning (DL) methods seems to be a promising solution to tackle difficult types of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, especially fake news detection. To unlock social media data, an automatic text classifier is highly helpful in the domain of NLP. The current research article focuses on the design of the Optimal Quad ChannelHybrid Long Short-Term Memory-based Fake News Classification (QCLSTM-FNC) approach. The presented QCLSTM-FNC approach aims to identify and differentiate fake news from actual news. To attain this, the proposed QCLSTM-FNC approach follows two methods such as the pre-processing data method and the Glovebased word embedding process. Besides, the QCLSTM model is utilized for classification. To boost the classification results of the QCLSTM model, a Quasi-Oppositional Sandpiper Optimization (QOSPO) algorithm is utilized to fine-tune the hyperparameters. The proposed QCLSTM-FNC approach was experimentally validated against a benchmark dataset.

People have used conventional media to distribute fake news and generate propaganda to sway public opinion since the dawn. However, new obstacles in detecting fake news have evolved with modern social media. Moreover, false news dissemination is becoming more like a business, with individuals being paid to generate bogus information, making old methods of detecting fake news inefficient. As a result, and because of the threat of fake news on societies, several academics are working to differentiate between false and authentic news by automating the detection process using machine learning. This paper addresses several known machine learning-based works for detecting bogus material based on context or content features. We will be explaining different methods for detecting fake news. We also describe various publicly available datasets for detecting false news. Finally, we conclude our paper by discussing the ongoing difficulties in detecting fake news. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Deep learning; Fake news; Machine learning; Misinformation detection; Natural language processing","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161430354"

This phenomenon sows confusion among the public and threatens the foundations of informed discourse and democracy. Addressing this issue, the present study explores the application of the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model for detecting fake news. With its deep learning architecture and contextual understanding of language, BERT offers a promising framework for this purpose. The model was trained and validated on a dataset distinguishing between 'Fake' and 'True' news, achieving an accuracy of 79.88% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.87. These metrics underscore the model's proficiency in classifying news articles correctly. The study's results demonstrate the potential of BERT in the realm of fake news detection, providing a novel tool for social media platforms to combat misinformation. Despite its efficacy, the research also highlights the model's limitations, including fluctuations in validation accuracy and a tendency to misclassify true news as fake, indicating areas for future improvement. This study contributes to the ongoing efforts to ensure the integrity of news content and offers a foundation for subsequent research in information authenticity. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","BERT; deep learning; fake news; machine learning; Misinformation","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185881142"

Various machine learning approaches have evaluated text and images to categorize false news over time, but they lack a comprehensive representation of relevant features. This paper presents an automated method for detecting fake news to counteract the spread of disinformation. The proposed multimodal EFND integrates contextual, social context, and visual data from news articles and social media to build a multimodal feature vector with a high level of information density. Using a multimodal factorized bilinear pooling, the gathered features are fused to improve their correlation and offer a more accurate shared representation. Finally, a Multilayer Perceptron is implemented over the shared representation for the classification of fake news. EFND is evaluated using a group of standard fake news datasets known as “FakeNewsNet”. EFND has outperformed the baseline and state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models.

To combat this issue, machine learning techniques have been used for fake news detection. In this study, we propose two models, LSTM and SVM, for fake news detection. The LSTM model is a deep learning algorithm that is particularly suited to sequential data such as text. It can capture long-term dependencies in the text and has shown promising results in natural language processing tasks. The SVM model, on the other hand, is a classical machine learning algorithm that has been widely used for classification tasks. To evaluate the performance of the proposed models, we conducted experiments on a dataset of news articles. Our results show that both models achieve high accuracy in detecting fake news. However, the LSTM model outperforms the SVM model with an accuracy of 94% compared to 89%. Furthermore, we conducted a feature importance analysis to determine the most important features for detecting fake news. The results show that the presence of certain words and phrases, such as ""unverified"" and ""anonymous sources"", are strong indicators of fake news. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of using machine learning techniques, particularly LSTM and SVM, for detecting fake news. This research can be applied to assist individuals and organizations in identifying and combating fake news in the digital age. © 2023 The Author(s).","Embedding; LSTM; RNN; SVM; Word to vector","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173526182"

Leveraging machine learning, including deep learning techniques, offers promise in combatting fake news. This paper goes beyond by establishing BERT as the superior model for fake news detection and demonstrates its utility as a tool to empower the general populace. We have implemented a browser extension, enhanced with explainability features, enabling real-time identification of fake news and delivering easily interpretable explanations. To achieve this, we have employed two publicly available datasets and created seven distinct data configurations to evaluate three prominent machine learning architectures. Our comprehensive experiments affirm BERT's exceptional accuracy in detecting COVID-19-related fake news. Furthermore, we have integrated an explainability component into the BERT model and deployed it as a service through Amazon's cloud API hosting (AWS). We have developed a browser extension that interfaces with the API, allowing users to select and transmit data from web pages, receiving an intelligible classification in return.

It is difficult for a common man to decide whether it is a misleading or a false information. And believing false information can lead to many problems such as making bad decisions, making unnecessary arguments, disturbances in relationships between people and can also lead to mental stress. Hence to avoid these consequences, this study proposes a novel model to detect the fake news efficiently and effectively. Proposed model is based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN). GNN belongs to the class of deep learning models, and it can work on nonlinear and multidimensional data. GNN can perform prediction tasks on graphs at node-level, edge-level and also entire graph-level. The reason for choosing GNN is Convolutional Neural Networks cannot be applied on nonlinear data as proposed dataset consists of nonlinear data and GNN can provide better accuracy for the model than Convolutional Neural Networks. Most of the models based on graph neural networks will need both text information and node features, but the proposed model can perform the prediction using only node features. This makes easier for us to detect the fake news with minimal computations without comprising in terms of accuracy.

People keep sharing false information even after it has been debunked. Those responsible for spreading misleading information in the first place should face the consequences, not the victims of their actions. Understanding how misinformation travels and how to stop it is an absolute need for society and government. Consequently, the necessity to identify false news from genuine stories has emerged with the rise of these social media platforms. One of the tough issues of conventional methodologies is identifying false news. In recent years, neural network models’ performance has surpassed that of classic machine learning approaches because of their superior feature extraction. This research presents Deep learningbased Fake News Detection (DeepFND). This technique has Visual Geometry Group 19 (VGG-19) and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) ensemble models for identifying misinformation spread through social media. This system uses an ensemble deep learning (DL) strategy to extract characteristics from the article’s text and photos. The joint feature extractor and the attention modules are used with an ensemble approach, including pre-training and fine-tuning phases. In this article, we utilized a unique customized loss function. In this research, we look at methods for detecting bogus news on the internet without human intervention. We used the Weibo, liar, PHEME, fake and real news, and Buzzfeed datasets to analyze fake and real news. Multiple methods for identifying fake news are compared and contrasted. Precision procedures have been used to calculate the proposed model’s output. The model’s 99.88% accuracy is better than expected. © 2023, K et al.

One of the most significant concerns is the proliferation of disinformation, or false and misleading information spread by individuals and organizations for the purpose of promoting their own ideologies and products. To combat this rise of disinformation, several text detection methods based on artificial intelligence and machine learning have been developed. This study presents a novel solution using a combination of Bi-LSTM, TCN, and attention mechanism. The proposed model leverages Glove Embedding for word representation, Bi-LSTM for capturing sequential text dependencies, attention mechanism for identifying important text elements, and TCN for deep feature extraction. The efficacy of the proposed model was assessed through empirical trials utilizing several models on the publicly available ISOT dataset. The results of these trials were highly impressive, demonstrating success of this research endeavor. © 2023 IEEE.","Attention Mechanism; Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM); Deep Learning; Fake News Detection; Natural Language Processing (NLP); Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163668619"

In this paper, we propose a learning technique for detecting fake news sources (i.e., fake users) on the Twitter platform. Three main types of features - tweet content, published time, and social graph - have been defined and extracted from Twitter to create a deep neural network (DNN) as a predictive model.

Some social media sources contribute to the propagation of fake news that has no real validity, but they accumulate over time and begin to appear in the feed of every consumer producing even more ambiguity. To sustain the value of social media, such stories must be distinguished from the true ones. As a result, an automated system is required to save time and money. The classification of fake news and misinformation from social media data corpora is the subject of this research. Several preprocessing and data improvement procedures are used to gather and preprocess two fake news datasets. Deep text features are extracted using word embedding models Word2vec and Global Vectors for Word representation while textual features are extracted using n-gram approaches named Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency and Bag of Words from both datasets individually. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is also employed to derive embedded representations from the input data. Finally, three Machine Learning (ML) and two Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are utilized for fake news classification. BERT also carries out the classification of embedded outcomes generated by it in parallel with the ML and DL models. In terms of overall performance, the DL-based Convolutional Neural Network stands out in the case of the first while BERT performs better in the case of the second dataset. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

Misinformation can have severe impacts on society across multiple domains: including health, politics, security, the environment, the economy and education. With the constant spread of misinformation on social media networks, a need has arisen to continuously assess the veracity of digital content. This need has inspired numerous research efforts on the development of misinformation detection (MD) models. However, many models do not use all information available to them and existing research contains a lack of relevant datasets to train the models, specifically within the South African social media environment. The aim of this paper is to investigate the transferability of knowledge of a MD model between different contextual environments. This research contributes a multimodal MD model capable of functioning in the South African social media environment, as well as introduces a South African misinformation dataset. The model makes use of multiple sources of information for misinformation detection, namely: textual and visual elements. It uses bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) as the textual encoder and a residual network (ResNet) as the visual encoder. The model is trained and evaluated on the Fakeddit dataset and a South African misinformation dataset. Results show that using South African samples in the training of the model increases model performance, in a South African contextual environment, and that a multimodal model retains significantly more knowledge than both the textual and visual unimodal models. Our study suggests that the performance of a misinformation detection model is influenced by the cultural nuances of its operating environment and multimodal models assist in the transferability of knowledge between different contextual environments. Therefore, local data should be incorporated into the training process of a misinformation detection model in order to optimize model performance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Deep Learning; Disinformation; Fake News Detection; Misinformation; Multimodal; Natural Language Processing; Social Media; South African; Transfer Learning","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180542631"

The issue has been actively researched using supervised learning for automatic fake news detection. Although accuracy is increasing, it is still limited to identifying fake information through channels on social platforms. This study aims to improve the reliability of fake news detection on social networking platforms by examining news from unknown domains. Especially, information on social networks in Vietnam is difficult to detect and prevent because everyone has equal rights to use the Internet for different purposes. These individuals have access to several social media platforms. Any user can post or spread the news through online platforms. These platforms do not attempt to verify users or the content of their locations. As a result, some users try to spread fake news through these platforms to propagate against an individual, a society, an organization, or a political party. In this paper, we proposed analyzing and designing a model for fake news recognition using Deep learning (called AAFNDL). The method to do the work is: 1) first, we analyze the existing techniques such as Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer (BERT); 2) we proceed to build the model for evaluation; and finally, 3) we approach some Modern techniques to apply to the model, such as the Deep Learning technique, classifier technique and so on to classify fake information. Experiments show that our method can improve by up to 8.72% compared to other methods. © 2022 China National Research Institute of Food and Fermentation Industries Co. Ltd.

Political events are one of the increases in the popularity and spread of fake news. The increasing of fake news is the major problem of today and will negatively impact the world. To avoid this type of bogus information spreading worldwide, we can use artificial intelligence and machine learning. Recently, deep learning techniques used complex natural language processing also to providing the solution for counterfeit news detection. Facebook is using AI techniques to filter the fake news stories from the user feeds.

This paper uses Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing techniques to classify Arabic news as fake or real. The spread of such information not only causes harm to the social fabric but undermines the integrity of digital information and creates an environment of hate, mistrust, and deception, weakening the bonds of social trust. This research can help eliminate and flag Arabic news that contains such threats by leveraging modern technologies. The Arabic language is morphologically rich, meaning words can have multiple meanings depending on their inflectional form. Furthermore, Arabic has numerous diacritics, which are small marks that indicate the pronunciation of vowels; this can make it harder to classify Arabic text. However, modern Natural Language Processing techniques provide enough assistance to eliminate these problems. We aim to utilize numerous approaches from Machine earning and Deep Learning perspectives. A single data set with various resources was used in the modeling and testing phases with the following ML approaches taken; Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Deep Learning (DL) approaches; Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), with promising results shown by the DL approach specifically LSTM. In conclusion, this research has shown that LSTM is the most effective method for detecting Arabic fake news, and with further research in the future, it will only improve.  © 2023 IEEE.","Arabic Fake News Detection; Classification; Deep Learning; Gated Recurrent Unit; K-Nearest-Neighbor; Linear Regression; Long-Short Term Memory; Machine Learning; Naïve Bayes; Random Forest; Recurrent Neural Network; Support Vector Machine","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176102421"

The more people rely on it, the more important it is to provide accurate data. Twitter makes it easy to spread misinformation, which can have a significant impact on how people feel, especially if false information spreads around COVID-19. Methodology: Unfortunately, twitter was also used to spread myths and misinformation about the illness and its preventative immunization. So, it is crucial to identify false information before its spread gets out of hand. In this research, we look into the efficacy of several different types of deep neural networks in automatically classifying and identifying fake news content posted on social media platforms in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. These networks include long short-term memory (LSTM), bi-directional LSTM, convolutional-neural-networks (CNN), and a hybrid of CNN-LSTM networks. Results: The ""COVID-19 Fake News"" dataset includes 42,280, actual and fake news cases for the COVID-19 pandemic and associated vaccines and has been used to train and test these deep neural networks.

The use of social media is easy, cost-effective, and saves time. People can access any news whenever they want without worrying about the time or where they are. Even though social media makes everything simple and easy, it also accelerates the propagation of fake news. The manual fake news identification process is time-consuming and requires expert human resources. Therefore, social media fake news detection has become a hot topic in the research world. However, only limited studies have addressed Sinhala fake news detection problem. This study proposes a new approach to identify Sinhala fake news in the early propagation stages before reaching a broader audience. The proposed method consists of content-based techniques to extract features and a deep learning approach to classify news items. Experimental results show that the model gained an 82% accuracy with FastText word embedding and the LSTM model. © 2023 IEEE.","deep learning; Fake news; natural language processing; social media; word embedding","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163526664"

In response, the need for robust and efficient methods to identify false information has become paramount. This paper introduces an innovative Hybrid Deep Learning approach that harnesses the capabilities of deep neural networks to improve the precision and dependability of information analysis within information systems. This approach combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), with a particular emphasis on the examination of textual and multimedia content. By integrating both CNNs and RNNs, this method adeptly captures spatial and temporal features, enabling the evaluation of textual and visual content from diverse sources. Moreover, the approach incorporates attention mechanisms to assess the relevance of different elements within the content, facilitating the fine-grained differentiation between authentic and deceptive information. A comparative examination of several methodologies has been carried out. The results exhibit a substantial enhancement in the precision of disinformation identification when compared to conventional machine learning methods and standalone deep learning models. © 2023 IEEE.","accuracy; convolution neural network; Machine learning models; Recurrent Neural Network","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184998774"

Due to the advancement of technology and the abundance of online content, it has become complicated to distinguish fake content from real one. Our research aims to explore different text preprocessing techniques and methodologies for accurately classifying news articles as genuine or fabricated. We have performed a range of text preprocessing and cleaning techniques to improve the quality of the dataset. We have also conducted topic modelling using latent semantic analysis on both real and fake news separately to get further insights. Exploratory data analysis such as identifying the most frequent words, and co-occurring words with varying window size have undoubtedly guided us to understand the distinct characteristics of genuine and fabricated news. Interpretable machine learning models like Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree and different deep learning models such as Bidirectional LSTM and Transformer-based networks have been used to build a classification model for detecting fake news. We found the transformer-based model performed better in terms of accuracy as well as computation time compared to the other models. We have also used different hyperparameter tuning and regularization methods to make the model simple enough to work on text data and reduce the overfitting vulnerability. Finally, the overall performance of these models has been compared to choosing the best model that could be used in other text classification tasks. Firstly, this paper highlights the importance of text preprocessing techniques and EDA in building accurate classifiers for fake news detection. Secondly, the proposed models provide an effective solution to detect fake news, which significantly impacts the credibility of online news sources. © 2023 IEEE.","Bidirectional LSTM; EDA; Fake News; KNN; Logistic Regression; Random Forest; SVM; Text Preprocessing; Transformer","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187956334"

Fake news detection (FND) is a binary classification task; that indicates if the news is right or not right, which involves predicting the probability that a certain news article is designed to be deceptive. Commonly, fake news is produced for political and financial purposes, e.g., influencing presidential elections or manipulating the stock market. Although many studies have been conducted to detect news in English as fake news, the evaluation of the credibility of news written in Arabic is still in its early stage. where FND in Arabic languages got underway to receive more interest in the last years, and many detection approaches present some ability to detect fake news on multiple datasets. Then interest in effective detection models has been growing; specifically, in the Arabic language which has lagged behind the work in other languages. In this paper, we used deep learning models and applied a convolutional neural network and long short-term memory (CNN-BiLSTM) with optimization of Stochastic gradient descent (SDG); to the Arabic accessible dataset called AFND; referring to Arabic Fake News Detection. Our experimental results based on the existing AFND dataset indicate an encouraging and good performance; as we reach an accuracy of 87.7%.

The discussion that we are having right now focuses on the single most essential problem, which is fake news. The term 'fake news' refers to a kind of propaganda or a problem that may include incorrect information and is often distributed through the media. The word itself comes from the English phrase 'fake news.' This encompasses not just the internet but also more conventional kinds of media, such as television, newspapers, and even smart phones, to name a few examples. In the society we live in today, where there is an abundance of social media networks, a large number of people are seeking to develop and share information, yet the vast majority of it is pointless and has little bearing on real-world issues. This misleading news is the major driving force behind the dissemination of various different political and commercial purposes. Those aims include: It is now becoming more difficult to differentiate between genuine news and actual news as a direct result of the proliferation of the internet world. In an effort to find a solution to the problem of fake news, we have been putting a lot of effort into developing the idea of a 'False news detecting system.'

Initially, the multi-modal information including images and text are gathered from real-time social media. Then, pre-processing of both images and text is carried out. Further, the text features are extracted using Word2vector and glove embedding techniques. Then, the optimal features from both image features and text features are attained using the Adaptive Water Strider Algorithm (A-WSA). The achieved optimal features are forwarded to the new feature fusion concept based on the weight factor that is optimized using the same A-WSA. Finally, the fused features are forwarded to the fake news classification stage with the help of “Optimized-Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (O-BiLSTM),” where the hyperparameter of BiLSTM is optimized through similar A-WSA.

With every day gone by, an increasing number of people have begun to rely on various websites for their daily dose of information. Due to the ever increasing popularity of these sources, the scope of spreading misinformation has also risen to a great extent. Rumors and biased news can spread like wildfire, thus undermining the credibility of news articles and causing trust in the media to dwindle. This recent surge in false information on social media has prompted extensive research in the field of online fake news detection. Hence, there is a need for efficient yet accurate fake news detection models which can be made accessible to everyone. In this research, we have explored the use of pre-trained distilled variants of the BERT model to identify fake news and rumors from actual online news. We compared the results before and after combining two smaller pre-trained BERT models into a single architecture with other approaches to see how well distilled models are able to learn the key features required to distinguish fake news from real.

It is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to manually review enormous volumes of digital data in order to detect false news, which is information that is not real in line with the facts. There is a new piece of fake news published every second; hence, the creation of automated systems is absolutely necessary in order to detect instances of fake news. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of various machine and deep learning approaches, as well as how the systems perform in identifying fake Urdu news, which are submitted in the shared tasks named UrduFake@FIRE2020 and UrduFake@FIRE2021. It was hoped that the shared tasks would attract new researchers to come up with algorithms that could detect Urdu fake news articles available in the digital media. More than 50 teams from ten different nations participated to find a solution to this binary classification issue. The objective of the shared tasks was to classify a given Urdu news instance as either real or fake, and the teams proposed numerous algorithms to achieve this goal. Among the several methods of text representation that have been investigated in this study are count-based BoW features and word vector embeddings. Traditional neural and non-neural network approaches, including BERT, XLNet and RoBERTa are also examined, and their analysis is presented. Moreover, precision, recall, F1Real, F1Fake, and F1Macro are used for evaluation. The winning system in 2021 employed the linear classifier function and achieved 0.679 F1Macro, while the highest performing system in 2020 was based on BERT and obtained 0.907 F1Macro. Thus, the results of this research show that machine learning classifiers underperformed in detecting Urdu fake news than deep learning techniques. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Analysis of methods; Fake news detection; Text classification","Book chapter","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163839760"

We must accept the fact that the opinion of an expert is frequently just as valuable and crucial as that of a non-expert. It is feasible to see how traditional media is undergoing changes and processes that diminish the importance of the traditional 'editing office' and place a growing focus on journalists' remote labour.As a result, social media has evolved into a component of national security since fake news and disinformation spread by nefarious individuals can influence readers and spark pointless debates on social issues that are inherently unimportant. This has a domino effect, instils dread in the populace, and eventually puts the security of the state in jeopardy.Recently, deep machine learning techniques have proven to be one of the technologies thought to be an effective way to combat the false news problem. However, due to shortages of labelled data, these methods often have poor model generalization capabilities when applied in real-world cases.In this paper, we address this problem by utilizing lightweight model stitching, which serves as a foundation for a hybrid method for fake news detection. Six distinct benchmark datasets have been used in our varied experiments.

Despite the growing importance of this issue, there is a lack of Indian context datasets to study the phenomenon of fake news in India. This paper calls for the need to create a dataset that captures the Indian context of fake news, in order to better understand the issue and develop effective solutions. For this we have created FakeRealIndian Dataset (FRI) for the purpose of conducting machine learning research on fake news detection. The dataset is built from a collection of 20,916 articles from various fact checked sources including real news from Times of India. Each article is manually labeled as fake or real. The real articles has been taken from the Times of India, Head Office. To the best of our knowledge and belief, FRI is the first Indian context labeled dataset which includes fake as well as real news stories and it is publicly available for research purposes. Additionally, we have also preprocessed our proposed dataset and created our own word embeddings. Those are also made public for the purposes of experimentation. Finally we anticipate that FRI can be a useful resource for researchers interested in examining the role of language, culture, and context in fake news detection.

Thus, to mitigate the consequences of fake news and its propagation, automated approaches to detect malicious content were created. This paper proposes an effective framework that utilizes only the text features of the news. We evaluate several features for differentiating fake from real news and we identify the best performing feature set that maximizes performance, using feature selection techniques. Text representation features were also explored as a potential solution. Additionally, the most popular Machine Learning and Deep Learning models were tested to conclude to the model that achieves the maximum accuracy.

The reasons behind the popularity of news articles tend to be varied and may include contemporaneity, writing quality, and other potential factors. In this article, we consider the problem of popularity prediction as a regression, developing several classes of features (metadata, contextual or content-based, temporal and social) and building models to predict popularity. The system presented here will be used in a real time environment. The other aspect of the paper is a summary of news articles on a particular topic. Since there are also various online resources that publish fake news, it is difficult to judge and understand which articles are fake. This paper focuses on the classification of the news as fake or real. The different Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning algorithms are studied for the implementation of the model.

In this paper, the deep learning models have implemented on the ISOT dataset which contains 137176 tweets data collected from twitter and some news data collected from different various sources including the news platforms. To extract features, both TD-IDF and bag of words are used. For generating vectors for words, glove embedding is applied. The deep learning models that have implemented are CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM and hybrid approach of CNN-BiLSTM. The highest accuracy that has achieved in this paper is 83% in both the classifiers i.e., CNN and LSTM. © 2023 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Fake News; Natural Language Processing; Neural Networks","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173832268"

The task primarily revolves around automatically identifying fake news by analyzing the combined use of text and images. Our system is structured into three distinct modules. The initial module is responsible for extracting textual information from images. The second module serves as a translation component, enabling the analysis of non-English text by converting it into English. Lastly, the classification module utilizes the outputs from the previous modules to predict the appropriate classes, allowing for accurate differentiation between various types of content. Our objective is to create a system that can predict these labels. To achieve this, we extract information from both the image and the text, specifically focusing on English language text and translating any textual data into English. Subsequently, both sets of data are utilized to train a classification-based model, which aims to predict the aforementioned labels.

However, real-world fake news datasets often suffer from the problem of class imbalance. These imbalanced datasets lead to unreliable and skewed classifier performance. Motivated by this, our paper addresses the class imbalance problem in fake news detection by employing a deep learning-based latent space resampling strategy. Firstly, a Bidirectional Variational Autoencoder is utilized to attain the most informative latent representations of the input text sequences. Next, the class-biased latent vectors are resampled using oversampling, undersampling, and hybrid-sampling techniques. The resampled latent vectors are then used to train several state-of-the-art classification algorithms and evaluated using a separate balanced testing set. Performance comparison with the imbalanced set serving as the baseline model and state-of-the-art methods, on the basis of the F1-score and Geometric mean, reveals that the proposed architecture is capable of alleviating the problem of class bias considerably. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Class imbalance; Fake news detection; Resampling; Social media","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171361473"

Such misinformation has the potential to affect public opinion, government credibility, and more. Therefore, automatic detection of fake news is an important and challenging problem that has not been well solved today. Fake news has three universally recognized characteristics: the text of an article, the user response it receives, and the source users promoting it. Existing work mainly focuses on formulating a solution for a certain feature, which cannot detect fake news more accurately. In this work, we propose a model that combines all three features to achieve more accurate and automated predictions. We propose a model called TSRI, which consists of four modules: Text, Source, Response, and Integrate. The first module is based on news text content, using the BERT+LSTM model, while considering the semantic representation of sentences and the long-distance dependencies between sentences. The second module uses GAT to model the network of replying and retweeting users based on social network features. The third module is based on the user's response to the news, using LDA to find conflicting opinions in the news tweets, and based on the identified tweets' opinions, constructs the credibility of the tweets and spreads the network, and finally obtains the module's value through iterative deduction. result. The last module combines the above three and outputs whether the news is true or false. © 2023 IEEE.","deep learning; fake news detection; natural language processing; neural network; social network","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165968791"

A manually annotated Hindi fake news links dataset was used for training the models which works on algorithms like Gaussian Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, LSTM, and others. On a benchmark dataset consisting of 932 fake and 1274 not-fake news links, the model has been successful in identifying most of the fake news links and we achieved an accuracy of 82.35% for the random forest model implemented on 10% test data and an accuracy of 61.10% for the LSTM model implemented on 10% test data. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Data annotation; Deep learning; Fact-check; Fake news detection; Machine learning; Social media","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172280259"

However, it is difficult to identify which sources are reliable and which are disseminating false information. So far, many models have been derived to detect fake news or misinformation from social media news using machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) techniques. This chapter aims to enhance the detection accuracy by representing the text of social media news in a hybrid format using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. We model the input data of news text in a hybrid representation using TF-IDF with N-grams model combined with Latent Semantic Indexing. The main objective of the hybrid text representation is to represent news text by considering the three important factors of text, viz. the important words in the text, their sequence of occurrence, and their semantic meaning. We applied different ML and DL techniques for news classification and compared the performance of fake news detection models with and without hybrid text representation. The obtained results evidence that there is a significant improvement in detection accuracies when the news text is represented in a hybrid format as proposed in our approach. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Fake news detection; Latent Semantic Indexing; Text representation; Vectorization","Book chapter","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139089838"

As a result, online media platforms enable us to absorb information more quickly and with fewer editorial constraints, and false information is disseminated at an extraordinary rate and on a massive scale. Many practical algorithms for identifying fake News have recently been created, which use unidirectional text sequence analysis. News and social context-level information were encoded using sequential neural networks. As a result, a bidirectional training strategy is capable of enhancing classification. This paper proposed Deep Fake BERT, a new model for identifying bogus News in online media. The model uses a BERT-based deep learning technique by integrating multiple simultaneous modules into a single-layer DCNN with various kernel filter sizes and strides. This combination can handle ambiguity, the most challenging aspect of natural language comprehension. This approach used classification methods such as Naive Bayes, Feed Forward Neural Networks, and LSTM, and prediction results were compared. Based on the comparison, the proposed model yields a classification accuracy is 99.25% to the existing methods.  © 2023 IEEE.","BERT; DCNN; Deep Fake BERT; Deep Learning; Fake News; LSTM; Naive Bases","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163094956"

People have started becoming techy and trendy, accessing all platforms over the internet to get some info or share info. The common problem among the present generation is believing and spreading fake news through social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, that may lead to the possibility of serious risk. Fake news is not just the info that makes people believe but also damages the reputation, respect, including life. It is tedious to identify the fake news over the internet as there would be no evidence to prove someone has been forging it. Therefore, various experiments have been conducted to identify the fake news spreading over the social media. In this paper, Machine learning techniques such as processing a dataset and analysing point to point have been studied. Moreover, methods such as Random Forest, Naive Bayes, CNN, ANN, SVM, and all possible approaches that would help to identify and deliver which data is real and which has been spreading fake over social media globally, have been summarized.  © 2023 IEEE.","fake news; Fake News Detection; Machine Learning; misleading news; Natural Language Processing; Online Social Network; Sentiment Analysis.

Recently, deep learning-based methods have been a mainstream approach for social media analysis models involving complex patterns. However, these methods are susceptible to biases in the training data, such as participation inequality. Basically, a mere 1% of users generate the majority of the content on social networking sites, while the remaining users, though engaged to varying degrees, tend to be less active in content creation and largely silent. These silent users consume and listen to information that is propagated on the platform. However, their voice, attitude, and interests are not reflected in the online content, making the decision of the current methods predisposed towards the opinion of the active users. So models can mistake the loudest users for the majority. We propose to leverage re-weighting techniques to make the silent majority heard, and in turn, investigate whether the cues from these users can improve the performance of the current models for the downstream task of fake news detection. © 2023 IEEE.","Fake News; Lurkers; Participation Inequality; Social Media; User behavior","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186144111"

Fake News (FNs) spreading through numerous institutions and sectors jeopardizes their reputations, causing users to abandon these platforms. Therefore, there is a huge pool of research in the area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques that are used to detect FNs. Previously, great focus was given to online review classification and free internet posts based on social networks. This research proposes a Deep Learning-based FNs Detection method. This paper proposes a Deep Learning (DL)-based method for detecting FNs. The proposed system consists of three phases; text encoding, feature extraction, and classification. The text encoding process is carried out on the input news words using GLOVE for word representation. The encoded words are then embedded into a specific word length in order to be enrolled in the proposed DL models. The proposed DL models comprise both automatic feature extraction and classification tasks. Furthermore, this study proposes four different DL models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Concatenated CNNs (C-CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units, to find an optimal model prior to the section of FNs that outperforms previous works.The proposed DL models are carried out on FNs and FNC datasets which are provided by kaggle, and the suggested C-CNNs algorithm obtained an accuracy of 99.6% and trained faster than others. Multiple evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1, and accuracy have been utilized to evaluate the outcome of the proposed models. The experimental results demonstrated overall improvements in the subject of FND when compared with the current models and validated the potential of the proposed methodology for the detection of FNs on Social Media (SM). This study will help researchers to broaden the knowledge of applications of CNNs based on DL methods for FND. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","CNN; CNNs-LSTM; Concatenated CNN; Deep Learning; Fake News Detection; GRU; LSTM","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134742005"

However, updated news sharing on social media is not always true.In this study, we focus on the challenges of numerous breaking-news rumors propagating on social media networks rather than long-lasting rumors. We propose new social-based and content-based features to detect rumors on social media networks. Furthermore, our findings show that our proposed features are more helpful in classifying rumors compared with state-of-the-art baseline features.

With the rise of social media, individuals may now distribute information for free, with hardly any inquiry and fewer restrictions than earlier. Detecting fake news has become a major concern. Document classification can be aided by extracting features. The technique of extracting a set of significant features is known as feature extraction from supervised and unsupervised data to help with categorization.

The dissemination of fake material could incite or defame prominent entities or individuals and may even serve the personal agendas of its makers, thereby posing societal encounters. Differentiating between fake and real news poses a substantial problem, mostly stemming from the constraints imposed by limited topic knowledge and time limitations. Based on the survey findings, Banten, DKI Jakarta, and West Java are the evident regions with the highest exposure to hoaxes and misinformation among their populations. An artificial intelligence (AI) methodology, the transformers, employs natural language processing (NLP), leveraging deep learning architectures to mitigate fake news. Transformers use a robust attention mechanism to concurrently process textual data and generate comprehensive and contextually informed word representations. A prior investigation demonstrates the higher performance of BERT, a transformer-based model, compared to the non-transformer approach. However, several studies have indicated that the performance of BERT models is potentially enhanced by utilizing advanced variants such as ALBERT and RoBERTa. Thus, further investigation is necessary to improve the utilization of modified BERT models in detecting fabricated news in Bahasa Indonesia. This study investigates various transformer models and clarifies that ALBERT performs superior to other models, achieving an accuracy of 87.6%, precision of 86.9%, F1-score of 86.9%, and a run-time of 174.5 seconds per epoch.

Fake news circulation is not only a current issue, but it has been disseminated for centuries. Dealing with fake news is a challenging task because it spreads massively. Therefore, automatic fake news detection is urgently needed. We introduced TB-BCG, Topic-Based BART Counterfeit Generator, to increase detection accuracy using deep learning. This approach plays an essential role in selecting impacted data rows and adding more training data. Our research implemented Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Topic-based), Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART), and Cosine Document Similarity as the main tools involved in Constraint @ AAAI2021-COVID19 Fake News Detection dataset shared task. This paper sets forth this simple yet powerful idea by selecting a dataset based on topic and sorting based on distinctive data, generating counterfeit training data using BART, and comparing counterfeit-generated text toward source text using cosine similarity. If the comparison value between counterfeit-generated text and source text is more than 95%, then add that counterfeit-generated text into the dataset. In order to prove the resistance of precision and the robustness in various numbers of data training, we used 30%, 50%, 80%, and 100% from the total dataset and trained it using simple Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Compared to baseline, our method improved the testing performance for both LSTM and CNN, and yields are only slightly different. © 2022 by the authors.

Social media platforms leverage the rapid production of a large volume of information and cause the propagation of untrustworthy and fake news. Since fake news is engineered to deceive a wide range of readers deliberately, it is not easy to detect them merely based on the news content. Hence, more information, such as the social context, is needed. Moreover, to limit the impact of fake news on society, it is essential to detect them as early as possible. In this paper, we have developed an automated system “DSS” for the early detection of fake news wherein we leverage the propagation tree and the stance network simultaneously and dynamically. Our proposed model comprises three major components: Dynamic analysis, Static analysis, and Structural analysis. During dynamic analysis, a recurrent neural network is used to encode the evolution pattern of the propagation tree and the stance network over time. The static analysis uses a fully connected network to precisely represent the overall characteristics of the propagation tree and the stance network at the end of a detection deadline. The node2vec algorithm is used during structural analysis as a graph embedding model to encode the structure of the propagation tree and the stance network. Finally, the outputs of these components are aggregated to determine the veracity of the news articles. Our proposed model is evaluated on the FakeNewsNet repository, comprising two recent well-known datasets in the field, namely PolitiFact and GossipCop. Our results show encouraging performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 8.2% on the PolitiFact and 3% on the GossipCop datasets.

Therefore, several Machine Learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks, have been used for fake news detection and classification. These techniques are widely used due to their learning capabilities. Besides, models based on artificial neural networks can be easily integrated into social media and websites to spot fake news early and avoid their propagation. Nevertheless, most fake news classification models are available only for English news, limiting the possibility of detecting fake news in other languages, such as Spanish. For this reason, this study proposes implementing a web service that integrates a deep learning model for the classification of fake news in Spanish. To determine the best model, the performance of several neural network architectures, including MLP, CNN, and LSTM, was evaluated using the F1 score., and LSTM using the F1 score.

Combating this phenomenon and detecting misleading information manually is rather boring, takes a long time, and impractical. It is therefore necessary to rely on the fields of artificial intelligence to solve this problem. As such, this study aims to use deep learning techniques to detect Arabic fake news based on Arabic dataset called the AraNews dataset. This dataset contains news articles covering multiple fields such as politics, economy, culture, sports and others. A Hybrid Deep Neural Network has been proposed to improve accuracy. This network focuses on the properties of both the Text-Convolution Neural Network (Text-CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to produce efficient hybrid model. Text-CNN is used to identify the relevant features, whereas the LSTM is applied to deal with the long-term dependency of sequence. The results showed that when trained individually, the proposed model outperformed both the Text-CNN and the LSTM. Accuracy was used as a measure of model quality, whereby the accuracy of the Hybrid Deep Neural Network is (0.914), while the accuracy of both Text-CNN and LSTM is (0.859) and (0.878), respectively.

The spread of fake news may misguide the public, cause social panic, and even lead to violence, which could be avoided by using early detection technology to timely identify fake news on social media. Since fake news is often deliberately designed to attract attention, it is difficult for mongers to provide pictures that match the fabricated stories. However, most of existing multi-modal solutions only use the information of images and text, but do not take into account the correlation between them, which limits the effect of model detection effect. In this paper, we proposed a novel Fake News Detection Framework (FNDF) in Sina Weibo based on hybrid feature fusion method. Specifically, a total of 16 features from text, images and users are extracted to distinguish fake news. Moreover, we extract image-text correlation between text and images. Then, a new deep neural network model called Fake News Net (FNN) is built to implement the detection of fake news, which makes use of a pre-training model named Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration (ERNIE), a convolution network named Visual Geometry Group (VGG-19), and a Back Propagation (BP) neural network. We validated it on a publicly available dataset, which shows that the F1-score of the FNN model reaches 95.90%, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 3.08%. The ablation experiment also proves that the correlation between images and texts increased the F1-score of the model by 3.15%. And the data balancing experiments show that our model still keeps outstanding detection performance when there is less fake news compared to real news, which is closer to the real-world scenario. The research in this paper provides theoretical methods and research ideas for the detection of fake news on social networks. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; Fake news; Image-text correlation; Social media","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134595178"

Given the accessibility to these means of communication and their rapidity, people resort more to them comparatively to the traditional media including radio, television and newspapers. However, dubious pieces of information such as fake news are often disseminated for malicious purposes. The proliferation of fake news has a strong negative impact on a society such as damage to the reputation of a personality, an organization or the aggravation of conflicts between its members. Due to the proliferation of fake news on these websites, the notion of veracity of information becomes a crucial issue. Research based on machine learning is promising. However, one of the main limitations is the efficiency of predictions. As a solution to detect fake news, we have proposed two models based on hybrid deep learning and evaluated our models on the two real datasets, namely ISOT and FA-KES.

From origin of virus, spread, self-medication to hoaxes on vaccination, it created more panic than the fatality of the virus. For better infodemic preparedness and control, it is necessary to mitigate fear among people, manage rumours, and dispel misinformation. A survey on Fake News during COVID-19 was made by Poynter Fact Check institute. It stated that major chunk of the fake news on COVID-19 originated majorly in Brazil, India, Spain, and the United States. Fake news menace is severe in countries where the trust on online media is high such as Brazil, Kenya and South Africa. Based on these observations, this study provides preliminary insight on the co-relation of the spatial and temporal meta-information of the news like the news source country, the name of the countries specified in the news, and date of publish of news to the credibility of news. The main contribution of this study is to analyse the impact of spatial and temporal information features for classification of fake news, which to the best of our knowledge has not been explored yet. Also, these features are directly not available in any news article available online. Hence, these features are handcrafted. Meta-data of the news article such as origin of news is considered. Additional spatial information is extracted from the news article using NER tagging. Temporal information such as date of origin of news is given as an input to the LSTM model. These features are given as an input to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model along with GloVe vectors and word length vector. A comparative analysis for accuracy is tested of the models with and without spatial and temporal information. The model with spatial and temporal information has achieved noteworthy results in fake news detection. To ensure the quality of prediction, various model parameters have been tuned and recorded for the best results possible. In addition to accuracy, the spatial and temporal information for fake news detection offers several other important implications for government and policy makers that will be instrumental in simulating future research on this subject. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19; Deep learning; Fake news detection; Infodemic; Spatio-temporal information","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132997754"

In recent years, machine learning has emerged as a promising approach to the automation of detecting and tracking fake news at scale. Current state of the art in the identification of fake news is generally focused on semantic analysis of the text, resulting in promising performance in automated detection of fake news. However, fake news campaigns are also evolving in response to such new technologies by mimicking semantic features of genuine news, which can significantly affect the performance of fake news classifiers trained on contextually limited features. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model for fake news detection that augments the semantic characteristics of the news with features extracted from the structure of the dissemination network. To this end, we first extend the LIAR dataset by integrating sentiment and affective features to the data, and then use a BERT-based model to obtain a representation of the text. Moreover, we propose a novel approach for fake news detection based on Graph Attention Networks to leverage the user-centric features and graph features of news residing social network in addition to the features extracted in the previous steps. Experimental evaluation of our approach shows classification accuracy of 97% on the Politifact dataset. We also examined the generalizability of our proposed model on the BuzzFeed dataset, resulting in an accuracy 89.50%.

Fake news has become a significant concern due to its harmful impact on individual attitudes and the community’s behavior. Researchers and social media service providers have commonly utilized artificial intelligence techniques in the recent few years to rein in fake news propagation. However, fake news detection is challenging due to the use of political language and the high linguistic similarities between real and fake news. In addition, most news sentences are short, therefore finding valuable representative features that machine learning classifiers can use to distinguish between fake and authentic news is difficult because both false and legitimate news have comparable language traits. Existing fake news solutions suffer from low detection performance due to improper representation and model design. This study aims at improving the detection accuracy by proposing a deep ensemble fake news detection model using the sequential deep learning technique. The proposed model was constructed in three phases. In the first phase, features were extracted from news contents, preprocessed using natural language processing techniques, enriched using n-gram, and represented using the term frequency–inverse term frequency technique. In the second phase, an ensemble model based on deep learning was constructed as follows. Multiple binary classifiers were trained using sequential deep learning networks to extract the representative hidden features that could accurately classify news types. In the third phase, a multi-class classifier was constructed based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) and trained using the features extracted from the aggregated outputs of the deep learning-based binary classifiers for final classification. The two popular and well-known datasets (LIAR and ISOT) were used with different classifiers to benchmark the proposed model. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, which use deep contextualized representation with convolutional neural network (CNN), the proposed model shows significant improvements (2.41%) in the overall performance in terms of the F1score for the LIAR dataset, which is more challenging than other datasets. Meanwhile, the proposed model achieves 100% accuracy with ISOT. The study demonstrates that traditional features extracted from news content with proper model design outperform the existing models that were constructed based on text embedding techniques. © 2022 by the authors.","deep learning; ensemble model; fake news detection; misinformation; two-stage classification","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138392990"

Despite its benefits, it has also made it easier for false information to spread rapidly, necessitating the need to identify and put a stop to it. It has also become a breeding ground for spammers who propagate fake content. The aim of this study is to classify news as authentic, false, or uncertain and to prevent the spread of misleading and inaccurate information. We aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape of Twitter fake news detection by conducting an in-depth analysis of the latest state-of-the-art models, which includes a comparison of their effectiveness as well as an assessment of their strengths and weaknesses. Following that, we have presented the problem statement, research objectives, and proposed methodology for detecting and preventing false information. To gain a deeper understanding of the prevalence and nature of fake news on social media, we conducted exploratory data analysis on Twitter, which is currently the most widely used platform for sharing information and engaging with others. After thoroughly examining the dataset, we have found a considerable presence of false tweets, emphasizing the pressing need for more effective methods to detect and counteract misinformation. These findings have important implications for social media platforms, news organizations, and policymakers. The motivation behind this work is to fight against the spread of inaccurate information and to tackle the problem of spammers who promote the fake content. Our objective is to offer an advanced solution that utilizes state-of-the-art technology to achieve exceptional performance and effectively address this problem.

Therefore, the detection of fake news has always been a hot issue. Fake news detection is typically a classification problem aiming at verifying the authenticity of news which is composed of multimedia contents such as texts, images and videos. This paper conducted a systematic study on fake news detection and its current mainstream methods. We pointed out an intrinsic characteristic of fake news, that is, fake news usually has specific propagation intentions, such as misleading the public, which is different from truth. Based on this characteristic, we first generally divided the propagation intentions of fake news into three categories, and analyzed the current research methods according to the corresponding relevant characteristics, aiming to enable readers to better understand this field from a new perspective. This paper also introduced the problem definition, basic paradigm, common datasets, evaluation metrics and state-of-the-art performances of fake news detection, and outlined some potential directions for future research. © 2022 Editorial Board of Journal of Signal Processing.

One of the most prevalent ways of misleading news is cheapfakes. Cheapfakes utilize non-AI techniques such as unaltered images with false context news to create false news, which makes it easy and “cheap” to create and leads to an abundant amount in the social media community. Moreover, the development of deep learning also opens and invents many domains relevant to news such as fake news detection, rumour detection, fact-checking, and verification of claimed images. Nevertheless, despite the impact on and harmfulness of cheapfakes for the social community and the real world, there is little research on detecting cheapfakes in the computer science domain. It is challenging to detect misused/false/out-of-context pairs of images and captions, even with human effort, because of the complex correlation between the attached image and the veracity of the caption content. Existing research focuses mostly on training and evaluating on given dataset, which makes the proposal limited in terms of categories, semantics and situations based on the characteristics of the dataset. In this paper, to address these issues, we aimed to leverage textual semantics understanding from the large corpus and integrated with different combinations of text-image matching and image captioning methods via ANN/Transformer boosting schema to classify a triple of (image, caption1, caption2) into OOC (out-of-context) and NOOC (no out-of-context) labels. We customized these combinations according to various exceptional cases that we observed during data analysis. We evaluate our approach using the dataset and evaluation metrics provided by the COSMOS baseline. Compared to other methods, including the baseline, our method achieves the highest Accuracy, Recall, and F1 scores. © 2022 by the authors.","cheapfakes; computer vision; deep learning; image-text matching; misinformation; natural language processing; transformer encoder","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141781594"

Some previous methods have focused on modeling the news content, while others have combined user comments and user information on social media. However, existing methods ignore some important clues for detecting fake news, such as temporal information on social media and external knowledge related to the news. To this end, we propose a Knowledge-Aware Hierarchical Attention Network (KAHAN) that integrates this information into the model to establish fact-based associations with entities in the news content. Specifically, we introduce two hierarchical attention networks to model news content and user comments respectively, in which news content and user comments are represented by different aspects for modeling various degrees of semantic granularity. Besides, to process the random occurrences of user comments at post-level, we further designed a time-based subevent division algorithm to aggregate user comments at subevent-level to learn temporal patterns. Moreover, News towards Entities (N-E) attention and Comments towards Entities (C-E) attention are introduced to measure the importance of external knowledge. Finally, we detected the veracity of the news by combining the three aspects of news: content, user comments, and external knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments and ablation studies on two real-world datasets and showed that our proposed method outperformed the previous methods and empirically validated each component of KAHAN1.  © 2022 ACM.","Deep Learning; Fake News Detection; Hierarchical Attention Network; Knowledge Graph; Natural Language Processing","Conference paper","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137497478"

This problem has significantly driven the effort of both academia and industries for developing more accurate fake news detection strategies: early detection of fake news is crucial. Unfortunately, the availability of information about news propagation is limited.

However, despite of having a lot of diversity and millions of native speakers, some languages like Bengali are under-resourced, which is due to lack of computational resources for natural language processing (NLP). Similar to other languages, Bengali social media contents also include images along with texts (e.g., multimodal memes are posted by embedding short texts into images on Facebook). Therefore, only the textual data is not enough to judge them since images might give extra context to make a proper judgement. This paper is about hate speech detection from multimodal Bengali memes and texts. We prepared the only multimodal hate speech dataset for-a-kind of problem for Bengali, which we use to train state-of-the-art neural architectures (e.g., Bi-LSTM/Conv-LSTM with word embeddings, ConvNets + pre-trained language models, e.g., monolingual Bangla BERT, multilingual BERT-cased/uncased, and XLM-RoBERTa) to jointly analyze textual and visual information for hate speech detection. Conv-LSTM and XLM-RoBERTa models performed best for texts, yielding F1 scores of 0.78 and 0.82, respectively. As of memes, ResNet-152 and DenseNet-161 models yield F1 scores of 0.78 and 0.79, respectively. As of multimodal fusion, XLM-RoBERTa + DenseNet-161 performed the best, yielding an F1 score of 0.83. Our study suggest that text modality is most useful for hate speech detection, while memes are moderately useful. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bengali; Hate speech detection; Multimodal memes; Transformer language models; Under-resourced language; Word embeddings","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173566054"

Online forums and social media have stimulated the broadcast of fake news by embedding it with truthful information. Thus, fake news has evolved into the main challenge of better impact in the information-driven community for intense fakesters. The detection of fake news articles that is generally found by considering the quality of the information in their news feeds under uncertain authenticity calls for automated tools. However, designing such tools is a major problem because of the multiple faces of fakesters. This paper offers a new text-analytics-driven method for detecting fake news to reduce the risks impacted by the consumption of fake news. The methodology for improved fake news detection focusses on four phases: (a) pre-processing, (b) feature extraction, (c) optimal feature selection and (d) classification. The pre-processing of the text data will be initially done by stop word removal, blank space removal and stemming. Further, the feature extraction is performed by term frequency-inverse document frequency, and grammatical analysis is done using mean, Q25, Q50, Q75, Max, Min and standard deviation. Then, the optimal feature selection is developed, which minimises the number of input variables. It is intended to reduce the number of input variables to improve the model's performance by minimising the computational cost of modelling. An improved meta-heuristic algorithm called successive position-based barnacles mating optimisation is used for optimal feature selection and classification. As the main contribution, the influence of deep learning is employed, which employs optimised long short-term memory. Finally, the result shows the superiority in terms of different significant measures by the proposed model over other methods for fake news detection experimentally done on a publicly available benchmark dataset.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Co.","Fake news detection; grammatical analysis; long short-term memory; optimal feature selection; successive position-based barnacles mating optimisation; term frequency-inverse document frequency; text pre-processing","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131862094"

With the help of social media, getting news is cheaper, faster, and easier. However, this has also led to an increase in the number of fake news articles, either by manipulating the text or morphing the images. The spread of fake news has become a serious issue all over the world. In one case, at least 20 people were killed just because of false information that was circulated over a social media platform. This makes it clear that social media sites need a system that uses more than one method to spot fake news stories. To solve this problem, we've come up with FakeRevealer, a single-configuration fake news detection system that works on transfer learning based techniques. Our multi-modal archutecture understands the textual features using a language transformer model called DistilRoBERTa and image features are extracted using the Vision Transformer (ViTs) that is pre-trained on ImageNet 2IK.

Specifically, we conducted a benchmark study using a wide range of (1) classical ML algorithms such as logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB) and an ensemble learning method of such algorithms, (2) advanced ML algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU), CNN-BiLSTM, CNN-BiGRU and a hybrid approach of such techniques and (3) DL transformer-based models such as BERT (Formula presented.) and RoBERTa (Formula presented.).

More people are exposed to breaking news on these sites in a shorter amount of time than they would be through established media outlets. When compared to more established news sources, fortunately, social networking sites have fewer safeguards in place to ensure that the information they transmit is accurate and trustworthy. Consequently, there is a requirement for automated fake news identification systems on these channels to limit the dissemination of disinformation. Conventional detection techniques from conventional news outlets are either ineffective or irrelevant when applied to the problem of detecting fraudulent information on social networking sites. In this study, we present a novel method for identifying fake news on social networking sites and halting its spread termed Learning based Fake Data Detection (LFDD). This algorithm focuses on the following: first, fake news is written with a goal to deceive readers into believing incorrect details; which renders detecting it based on news content difficult and nontrivial; thus, we need to include additional details, including user interactions on social networks, in order to aid in making an assessment. Furthermore, people' social contacts with false news generate large amounts of details that are fragmentary, unorganized and loud, making it difficult to extract valuable data from it. This research is intended to help inquiry into the complex and timely topic of identifying false news on social networking sites.  © 2023 IEEE.","Cyber Security; Deep Learning; Fake News; Learning based Fake Data Detection; LFDD; Social Media; Text Processing","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186145633"

Fake news proliferation is a major issue as it has socio-political impacts and it may change the opinion of the people. The easy dissemination of information through social media has added to exponential growth of fake news. Thus, it is challenging task to detect the fake news on the internet. In the literature, fake news detection techniques have been developed using machine learning approaches. Usually, fake news consists of sequential data. Recently, different variants of the Recurrent Neural Networks have been used for fake news detection due to better handling of sequential data and preserving better context information. Due to diversity in fake news data there is still need to develop the fake news detection techniques with better performance. In this work, we have developed a hybrid fake news detection model which aims at better representation learning to enhance the fake news detection performance. The proposed hybrid model has been developed using N-gram with TF-IDF to extract the content-based features then sequential features have been extracted using deep learning model [LSTM or bidirectional Encoder representation from transformers (BERT)]. The performance of the proposed approach has been evaluated using two publicly available datasets. It is observed from results that the proposed approach performs better the fake news detection approaches developed in the literature. The proposed approach has given the accuracies of 96.8% and 94% for the WELFAKE and KaggleFakeNews datasets, respectively. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Fake news; Fake news on social media; Fake using deep learning; Long short-term memory (LSTM); N-gram model; Representation learning","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141368246"

Several methods have already been proposed for the automatic detection of fake news, which are often based on the statistical features of the content or context of news. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection method based on Natural Language Inference (NLI) approach. Instead of using only statistical features of the content or context of the news, the proposed method exploits a human-like approach, which is based on inferring veracity using a set of reliable news. In this method, the related and similar news published in reputable news sources are used as auxiliary knowledge to infer the veracity of a given news item. We also collect and publish the first inference-based fake news detection dataset, called FNID, in two formats: the two-class version (FNID-FakeNewsNet) and the six-class version (FNID-LIAR). We use the NLI approach to boost several classical and deep machine learning models, including Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, BiGRU, and BiLSTM along with different word embedding methods including Word2vec, GloVe, fastText, and BERT. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves 85.58% and 41.31% accuracies in the FNID-FakeNewsNet and FNID-LIAR datasets, respectively, which are 10.44% and 13.19% respective absolute improvements. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Content features; Fake news detection; Natural language inference; Social media","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128664585"

This study proposes an automatic fake news detection system that supports or disproves the dubious claims while returning a set of documents from verified sources. The system is composed of multiple modules and it makes use of different techniques from machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing. Such techniques are used for the selection of relevant documents, to find among those, the ones that are similar to the tested claim and their stances.

Because of the easy availability and exponential expansion of data through social media networks, distinguishing between fake and real information is not straightforward. Most smartphone users tend to read news on social media rather than on the internet. The information published on news websites often needs to be authenticated. The simple spread of information and news by instant sharing has included the exponential growth of its misrepresentation. So, fake news has been a major issue ever since the growth and expansion of the internet for the general mass. This paper employs several machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing techniques for detecting false news, such as logistic regression, decision tree, naive bayes, support vector machine, long short-term memory, and bidirectional encoder representation from transformers. Initially, the machine learning and deep learning approaches are trained using an open-source fake news detection dataset to determine if the information is authentic or counterfeit. In this work, the corresponding feature vectors are generated from various feature engineering methods such as regex, tokenization, stop words, lemmatization and term frequency-inverse document frequency. All the machine learning and natural language processing models’ performance were evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F-1 score, ROC curve, etc. For the machine learning models, logistic regression, decision tree, naive bayes, and SVM achieved classification accuracies of 73.75%, 89.66%, 74.19%, and 76.65%, respectively. Finally, the LSTM attained 95% accuracy, and the NLP-based BERT technique obtained the highest accuracy of 98%. © 2022 by the authors.","bidirectional encoder representation from transformers; fake news detection; lemmatization; long short-term memory; naive Bayes; support vector machine; tokenization","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142493320"

Thus, detecting fake news on social media is extremely important but technically challenging.

The potential to spread fake news (FN) to many organizations and platforms jeopardizes news credibility and causes users to abandon them. However, detecting FN entails predicting the probability that a particular news article is deceptive or not. However, most contemporary methods do not consider Arabic news and how Arabic FN (AFN) has been detected in the past decade. Therefore, research on AFN detection is beginning to receive more attention. This paper presents an Arabic FN detection (AFND) system based on hybrid deep learning (DL) model. This model includes both conventional neural network and long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) modalities. The input dataset was prepared via discretization and normalization. Then, word vectors were included with the corrected words at a given word length as pretrained vectors on Arabic news. Due to outstanding performance, the JSO optimization algorithm was combined with the framework to automatically define the best structure for the proposed CNN-LSTM. A comparison was made between the proposed CNN-LSTM and other recent models to prove the performance of the proposed CNN-LSTM.

With the global nature of social media and hardly any checks in place on posting of content, exponential increase in spread of fake news is easy. Businesses propagate fake news to improve their economic standing and influencing consumers and demand, and individuals spread fake news for personal gains like popularity and life goals. The content of fake news is diverse in terms of topics, styles and media platforms, and fake news attempts to distort truth with diverse linguistic styles while simultaneously mocking true news. All these factors together make fake news detection an arduous task. This work tried to check the spread of disinformation on Twitter. Design/methodology/approach: This study carries out fake news detection using user characteristics and tweet textual content as features. For categorizing user characteristics, this study uses the XGBoost algorithm. To classify the tweet text, this study uses various natural language processing techniques to pre-process the tweets and then apply a hybrid convolutional neural network–recurrent neural network (CNN-RNN) and state-of-the-art Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) transformer. Findings: This study uses a combination of machine learning and deep learning approaches for fake news detection, namely, XGBoost, hybrid CNN-RNN and BERT. The models have also been evaluated and compared with various baseline models to show that this approach effectively tackles this problem. Originality/value: This study proposes a novel framework that exploits news content and social contexts to learn useful representations for predicting fake news. This model is based on a transformer architecture, which facilitates representation learning from fake news data and helps detect fake news easily. This study also carries out an investigative study on the relative importance of content and social context features for the task of detecting false news and whether absence of one of these categories of features hampers the effectiveness of the resultant system. This investigation can go a long way in aiding further research on the subject and for fake news detection in the presence of extremely noisy or unusable data. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Classification; Fake news; Gradient boosting; Text classification; Transfer learning; Transformers; Twitter","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138133063"

However, the information that is available and shared online is not always credible. These platforms provide a fertile ground for the rapid propagation of breaking news along with other misleading information. The enormous amounts of fake news present online have the potential to trigger serious problems at an individual level and in society at large. Detecting whether the given information is fake or not is a challenging problem and the traits of social media makes the task even more complicated as it eases the generation and spread of content to the masses leading to an enormous volume of content to analyze. The multimedia nature of fake news on online platforms has not been explored fully. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art techniques for combating fake news on online media with the prime focus on deep learning (DL) techniques keeping multimodality under consideration. Apart from this, various DL frameworks, pre-trained models, and transfer learning approaches are also underlined. As till date, there are only limited multimodal datasets that are available for this task, the paper highlights various data collection strategies that can be used along with a comparative analysis of available multimodal fake news datasets. The paper also highlights and discusses various open areas and challenges in this direction. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Deep learning; Fake news detection; Multimodal; Pretrained models; Rumor detection; Text embedding; Transfer learning","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133592789"

In the digital era, especially in COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, fake news is used to mislead society for certain purposes. Social media such as Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp are used as a platform to spread false news. To identify fake news, we have to manually verify the news with legitimate sources. However, this takes some effort and time rather than using fake news detection systems. A good fake news detection system is needed to reduce the spread of misleading information and those side effects of it. Most of the recent research in English fake news detection systems has already used deep learning models especially transformer models. However, research in Indonesian fake news detection systems is still using old machine learning approaches. In this study, we proposed IndoBERT, an Indonesian Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) based transformer model that focuses on the context and attention of the input sentences. For the experiment, we fine-tuned the proposed model with the dataset that was collected from turnbackhoax.id and adjusted hyperparameter to get the best result.

Fake news can seriously impact society in many fields including politics, finance, sports, etc. Many studies have been conducted to help detect fake news in English, but research conducted on fake news detection in the Arabic language is scarce. Our contribution is twofold: first, we have constructed a large and diverse Arabic fake news dataset. Second, we have developed and evaluated transformer-based classifiers to identify fake news while utilizing eight state-of-the-art Arabic contextualized embedding models. The majority of these models had not been previously used for Arabic fake news detection.

However, most current approaches utilize the features from a single modality, such as text or image, while the comprehensive fusion between features of different modalities has been ignored. To deal with the above problem, we propose a novel model named Bidirectional Cross-Modal Fusion (BCMF), which comprehensively integrates the textual and visual representations in a bidirectional manner. Specifically, the proposed model is decomposed into four submodules, i.e., the input embedding, the image2text fusion, the text2image fusion, and the prediction module. We conduct intensive experiments on four real-world datasets, i.e., Weibo, Twitter, Politi, and Gossip. The results show 2.2, 2.5, 4.9, and 3.1 percentage points of improvements in classification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art methods on Weibo, Twitter, Politi, and Gossip, respectively. The experimental results suggest that the proposed model could better capture integrated information of different modalities and has high generalizability among different datasets. Further experiments suggest that the bidirectional fusions, the number of multi-attention heads, and the aggregating function could impact the performance of the cross-modal fake news detection. The research sheds light on the role of bidirectional cross-modal fusion in leveraging multi-modal information to improve the effect of fake news detection. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Contextualized embedding; Cross-modal fusion; Deep learning; Fake news detection","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136050961"

The vast distribution of false information on social media has become a worldwide threat. As a result, the Fake News Detection System in Social Networks has risen in popularity and is now considered an emerging research area. A centralized training technique makes it difficult to build a generalized model by adapting numerous data sources. In this study, we develop a decentralized Deep Learning model using Federated Learning (FL) for fake news detection. We utilize an ISOT fake news dataset gathered from ""Reuters.com""(N = 44,898) to train the deep learning model. The performance of decentralized and centralized models is then assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score measures. In addition, performance was measured by varying the number of FL clients. We identify the high accuracy of our proposed decentralized FL technique (accuracy, 99.6%) utilizing fewer communication rounds than in previous studies, even without employing pre-trained word embedding. The highest effects are obtained when we compare our model to three earlier research. Instead of a centralized method for false news detection, the FL technique may be used more efficiently. The use of Blockchain-like technologies can improve the integrity and validity of news sources. © 2022 IEEE.","CNN; Decentralized Deep Learning; Fake News Detection; Federated Learning","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143907409"

Regrettably, one of the most popular subjects on social media right now is the crisis between Russia and Ukraine. Spreading fake news about this conflict may cause serious consequences to both countries and their citizens. Therefore, we are motivated to build a fake news detection system similar to those systems already accessible in other fields like healthcare. In this study, we build a dataset of fake and real tweets about the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and evaluate the power of machine learning in this context. The pre-train BERT and five classical machine learning algorithms; namely support vector machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), and Naïve Bayes (NB) are trained and evaluated through different scenarios of the dataset. The results show that it is possible to develop a system that can discern between real and fake news regarding the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.

The tremendous leverage of social media applications in daily life makes them significant information sources. Users can post and share different types of information in all their forms with a single click. However, the cost becomes expensive and dangerous when non-experts say anything about anything. Fake news are rapidly dominating the dissemination of disinformation by distorting people’s views or knowledge to influence their awareness and decision-making. Therefore, we have to identify and prevent the problematic effects of falsified information as soon as possible. In this paper, we conducted three experiments with machine learning classifiers, deep learning models, and transformers. In all experiments, we relied on word embedding to extract contextual features from articles. Our experimental results showed that deep learning models outperformed machine learning classifiers and the BERT transformer in terms of accuracy. Moreover, results showed almost the same accuracy between the LSTM and GRU models.

They undermine confidence in the media in general. Current NLP systems are still lacking the ability to properly interpret and classify Arabic fake news. Given the high stakes involved, determining truth in social media has recently become an emerging research that is attracting tremendous attention. Our literature review indicates that applying the state-of-The-Art approaches on news content address some challenges in detecting fake news' characteristics, which needs auxiliary information to make a clear determination. Moreover, the Social-context-based' and propagation-based' approaches can be either an alternative or complementary strategy to content-based approaches. The main goal of our research is to develop a model capable of automatically detecting truth given an Arabic news or claim. In particular, we propose a deep neural network approach that can classify fake and real news claims by exploiting Convolutional Neuron Networks'. Our approach attempts to solve the problem from the fact checking perspective, where the fact-checking task involves predicting whether a given news text claim is factually authentic or fake. We opt to use an Arabic balanced corpus to build our model because it unifies stance detection, stance rationale, relevant document retrieval and fact-checking. The model is trained on different well selected attributes. An extensive evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate the ability of the fact-checking task in detecting the Arabic fake news. Our model outperforms the performance of the state-of-The-Art approaches when applied to the same Arabic dataset with the highest accuracy of 91%.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.","Arabic corpus; Convolutional Neural Network; Deep learning; Fact checking; Fake news detection; Social media","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130441754"

Unverified news is often disseminated in the form of multimedia content like text, picture, audio, or video. The dissemination of such false news deceives the public and leads to protests and creates troubles for the public and the government. Hence, it is essential to verify the authenticity of the news at an early stage before sharing it with the public. Earlier fake news detection (FND) approaches combined textual and visual features, but the semantic correlations between words were not addressed and many informative visual features were lost. To address this issue, an automated fake news detection system is proposed, which fuses textual and visual features to create a multimodal feature vector with high information content. The proposed work incorporates the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model to extract the textual features, which preserves the semantic relationships between words. Unlike the convolutional neural network (CNN), the proposed capsule neural network (CapsNet) model captures the most informative visual features from an image. These features are combined to obtain a richer data representation that helps to determine whether the news is fake or real. We investigated the performance of our model against different baselines using two publicly accessible datasets, Politifact and Gossipcop. Our proposed model achieves significantly better classification accuracy of 93% and 92% for the Politifact and Gossipcop datasets, respectively, compared to 84.6% and 85.6% for the SpotFake+ model. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","BERT; Capsule neural network; Deep learning; Fake news detection; Routing-by-agreement","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121859108"

For fake news stance detection, for example, many classification-based models have been proposed often with high complexity and hand-crafted features. Although these models can achieve high accuracy scores on a targeted small corpus of fake news, few are evaluated on a larger corpus of fake and conspiracy sites due to efficiency limitations and the lack of compatibility with the actual fact-checking process. In this article, we propose a practical two-stage stance detection model that is tailored to the real-life problem. Specifically, we integrate an information retrieval system with an end to end memory network model to sort articles based on their relevance to the claim and then identify the fine-grained stance of each relevant article towards its given claim. We evaluate our model on the Fake News Challenge dataset (FNC-1). The results show that the performance of our model is comparable to those of the state-of-the-art models, average weighted accuracy of 82.1, while it closely follows the real-life process of fact-checking. We also validate our model with a large dataset from a real-life fact-checking website (i.e., Snopes.com), and the findings demonstrate the capability of the model in distinguishing false from true news headlines.  © 2015 IEEE.","Deep memory networks; fake news detection; fake rumors detection/debunking; information retrieval systems; news retrieval systems; stance detection","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099218409"

As a consequence, we are more susceptible to the pernicious impact that misinformation and disinformation spreading can have on different segments of our society. Thus, the development of tools for the automatic detection of fake news plays an important role in the prevention of its negative effects. Most attempts to detect and classify false content focus only on using textual information. Multimodal approaches are less frequent and they typically classify news either as true or fake. In this work, we perform a fine-grained classification of fake news on the Fakeddit dataset, using both unimodal and multimodal approaches. Our experiments show that the multimodal approach based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture combining text and image data achieves the best results, with an accuracy of 87%. Some fake news categories, such as Manipulated content, Satire, or False connection, strongly benefit from the use of images. Using images also improves the results of the other categories but with less impact. Regarding the unimodal approaches using only text, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is the best model, with an accuracy of 78%.

A good disinformation detection system is needed to reduce the spread of misleading information and its associated consequences.

Data augmentation is a frequently used approach to overcome issues related to the lack of data or problems related to imbalanced classes. Such techniques are used to generate artificial data samples used to improve the volume of the training set or to balance the target distribution. In the antisocial behavior detection domain, we frequently face both issues, the lack of quality labeled data as well as class imbalance. As the majority of the data in this domain is textual, we must consider augmentation methods suitable for NLP tasks. Easy data augmentation (EDA) represents a group of such methods utilizing simple text transformations to create the new, artificial samples. Our main motivation is to explore EDA techniques’ usability on the selected tasks from the antisocial behavior detection domain. We focus on the class imbalance problem and apply EDA techniques to two problems: fake news and toxic comments classification. In both cases, we train the convolutional neural networks classifier and compare its performance on the original and EDA-extended datasets. EDA techniques prove to be very task-dependent, with certain limitations resulting from the data they are applied on. The model’s performance on the extended toxic comments dataset did improve only marginally, gaining only 0.01 improvement in the F1 metric when applying only a subset of EDA methods. EDA techniques in this case were not suitable enough to handle texts written in more informal language. On the other hand, on the fake news dataset, the performance was improved more significantly, boosting the F1 score by 0.1. Improvement was most significant in the prediction of the minor class, where F1 improved from 0.67 to 0.86. © 2022 by the authors.","antisocial behavior; data augmentation; deep learning; EDA; fake news detection; toxic comments","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138745468"

During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, false information is affecting human life in many spheres The world needs automated detection technology and efforts are being made to meet this requirement with the use of artificial intelligence. Neural network detection mechanisms are robust and durable and hence are used extensively in fake news detection. Deep learning algorithms demonstrate efficiency when they are provided with a large amount of training data. Given the scarcity of relevant fake news datasets, we built the Coronavirus Infodemic Dataset (CovID), which contains fake news posts and articles related to coronavirus. This paper presents a novel framework, the Allied Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Network (ARCNN), to detect fake news based on two different modalities: text and image. Our approach uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and combines both streams to generate a final prediction. We present extensive research on various popular RNN and CNN models and their performance on six coronavirus-specific fake news datasets. To exhaustively analyze performance, we present experimentation performed and results obtained by combining both modalities using early fusion and four types of late fusion techniques. The proposed framework is validated by comparisons with state-of-the-art fake news detection mechanisms, and our models outperform each of them. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19 fake news; Deep learning; Infodemic; Multimodal fusion; Neural networks","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119918428"

How to effectively identify fake news is a challenging problem that has received great attention from academic and industry. Existing deep learning methods for fake news detection require a large amount of labeled data to train the model, but obtaining labeled data is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. To extract useful information from a large amount of unlabeled data, some contrastive learning methods for fake news detection are proposed. However, existing contrastive learning methods only randomly sample negative samples at different training stages, resulting in the role of negative samples not being fully played. Intuitively, increasing the contrastive difficulty of negative samples gradually in a way similar to human learning will contribute to improve the performance of the model. Inspired by the idea of curriculum learning, we propose a curriculum contrastive model (CCFD) for fake news detection which automatically select and train negative samples with different difficulty at different training stages. Furthermore, we also propose three new augmentation methods which consider the importance of edges and node attributes in the propagation structure to obtain more effective positive samples. The experimental results on three public datasets show that our model CCFD outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models for fake news detection. © 2022 ACM.","contrastive learning; curriculum learning; fake news detection; negative samples; positive samples","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140850606"

This work has made an attempt to automate the fake news detection process by employing the logistic regression (LR) and latest and modified word embedding technique. In this paper, we worked on the fake news recognition mechanism for 2 different datasets, viz. dataset comprising online traditional news articles and news collected from a wide range of sources.

While current state-of-the-art systems are mostly based on geometric deep-learning models, these architectures still need human-labeled data to be trained and updated — due to shifting topic distributions and adversarial attacks. Most research on automatic misinformation detection, however, neither considers time budget constraints on the number of pieces of news that can be manually fact-checked, nor tries to reduce the burden of fact-checking on – mostly pro bono – annotators and journalists. The first contribution of this work is a thorough analysis of active learning (AL) strategies applied to Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for misinformation detection. Then, based on this analysis, we propose Deep Error Sampling (DES) — a new deep active learning architecture that, when coupled with uncertainty sampling, performs equally or better than the most common AL strategies and the only existing active learning procedure specifically targeting fake news detection. Overall, our experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that all AL strategies outperform random sampling, allowing – on average – to achieve a 2% increase in AUC for the same percentage of third-party fact-checked news and to save up to 25% of labeling effort for a desired level of classification performance. As for DES, while it does not always clearly outperform other strategies, it still reduces variance in the performance between rounds, resulting in a more reliable method. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to comprehensively study active learning in the context of misinformation detection and to show its potential to reduce the burden of third-party fact-checking without compromising classification performance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Active learning; Disinformation; Fake news; Graph neural; Misinformation; Neural networks","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149058902"

In general, multimodal-based methods can achieve better performance because of the complementation among different modalities. However, the majority of them simply concatenate features from different modalities, failing to well preserve the mutual information in common features. To address this issue, a novel framework named semantic-enhanced multimodal fusion network is proposed for fake news detection, which can better capture mutual features among events and thus benefit the detection of fake news. This model consists of three subnetworks, namely multimodal fusion and event domain adaptation networks as well as the fake news detector. Specifically, the multimodal fusion network aims to extract deep features from texts and images and fuse them into a common semantic feature known as a snapshot. Then, the fake news detector can learn the representation of posts. Finally, the event domain adaptation network can single out and remove the peculiar features of each event, and keep shared features among events. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms some state-of-the-art approaches on two real-world multimedia data sets. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","deep learning; domain adaptation; fake news detection; multimedia; natural language processing","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138528588"

However, most news spread through social networks including Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram has unknown sources, thus having a significant impact on news consumers. Fake news on COVID‐19, which is affecting the global population, is propagating quickly and causes social disorder. Thus, a lot of research is being conducted on the detection of fake news on COVID‐19 but is facing the problem of a lack of datasets. In order to alleviate the problem, we built a dataset on COVID‐19 fake news from fact‐checking websites in Korea and propose deep learning for detecting fake news on COVID‐19 using the datasets. The proposed model is pre‐trained with large‐scale data and then performs transfer learning through a BiLSTM model. Moreover, we propose a method for initializing the hidden and cell states of the BiLSTM model to a [CLS] token instead of a zero vector. Through experiments, the proposed model showed that the accuracy is 78.8%, which was improved by 8% compared with the linear model as a baseline model, and that transfer learning can be useful with a small amount of data as we know it. A [CLS] token containing sentence information as the initial state of the BiLSTM can contribute to a performance improvement in the model. © 2022 by the authors.

Sentiment quantification, a new research problem in this field, extends sentiment analysis from individual documents to an aggregated collection of documents. Sentiment analysis has been widely researched, but sentiment quantification has drawn less attention despite offering a greater potential to enhance current business intelligence systems. In this research, to perform sentiment quantification, a framework based on feature engineering is proposed to exploit diverse feature sets such as sentiment, content, and part of speech, as well as deep features including word2vec and GloVe. Different machine learning algorithms, including conventional, ensemble learners, and deep learning approaches, have been investigated on standard datasets of SemEval2016, SemEval2017, STS-Gold, and Sanders. The empirical-based results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed feature sets in the process of sentiment quantification when applied to machine learning algorithms. The results also reveal that the ensemble-based algorithm AdaBoost outperforms other conventional machine learning algorithms using a combination of proposed feature sets. The deep learning algorithm RNN, on the other hand, shows optimal results using word embedding-based features. This research has the potential to help diverse applications of sentiment quantification, including polling, trend analysis, automatic summarization, and rumor or fake news detection. © 2022 by the authors.

They regularly consume news from online media sources such as social media and online newspapers. People also tend to spread the information received without confirming its truth. As the spread of fake news online grows, the public and researchers have become more interested in identifying fake news. The content of fake news that has manipulative information has negative effects on individuals and society. Most existing research investigates different kinds of features from news articles to develop fake news detection. The existing research is not capable of determining fake news for the Malay language due to lake of resources for Malay Language. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the performance of the proposed Bidirectional RNN deep learning approach to classify fake Malay news by varying the dropout rate of the proposed RNN model. In this work, four different dropout’s values are used to evaluate the performance of the RNN models, which are 0.1 (Model M1), 0.3 (Model M2), 0.5 (Model M3) and 0.8 (Model M4). Based on the results obtained, the smaller is the dropout rate the less number of epochs is required to train the RNN model as it is observed that Model M1 required more number of epochs to train the RNN model. However, the best accuracy can be obtained when the dropout rate was 0.3 with 90.1% accuracy in Model M2. Having higher percentage of dropout rate will not produce a trained model that can perform with high accuracy value. In conclusion, maintaining the percentage of dropout to be 0.3 and below enables the LSTM to produce good values of accuracies. The accuracy of the forecasted result is highly influenced by the length of the text. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Deep learning approach; Detection and classification; Malay fake news","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161381563"

As the issue of fake news continues to grow, there is an escalating need for reliable and efficient methods to detect and combat misinformation. Metaheuristics present a robust solution for addressing complex optimization problems by iteratively exploring the search space. Our proposed approach leverages metaheuristic techniques, such as particle swarm optimization and firefly algorithm, to automatically extract valuable features from textual content and user interactions. The objective is to evaluate the performance of these techniques by comparing them thereby confirming the effectiveness of metaheuristic algorithms. To achieve this, we carefully fine-tune the hyperparameters by synthesizing feature vectors obtained through techniques like TF-IDF and sentence transformers such as BERT and RoBERTa. These feature vectors are then combined with fitness vectors extracted using a metaheuristic swarm intelligence (SI) algorithm. Our experiments involve evaluating a substantial dataset of news articles, such as ISOT, to train and test the classifier. The experimental results unequivocally demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the metaheuristic approaches in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Through this research, our aim is to provide insights into how metaheuristic algorithms and advanced feature extraction techniques can significantly enhance the classification of fake news. © 2023 IEEE.","deep learning; fake news; swarm intelligence algorithms","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179848669"

Consequently, applications such as opinion mining, fake news detection or document classification that assign documents to predefined categories have significantly benefited from pre-trained language models, word or sentence embeddings, linguistic corpora, knowledge graphs and other resources that are in abundance for the more popular languages (e.g., English, Chinese, etc.). Less represented languages, such as the Kazakh language, balkan languages, etc., still lack the necessary linguistic resources and thus the performance of the respective methods is still low. In this work, we develop a model that classifies scientific papers written in the Kazakh language using both text and image information and demonstrate that this fusion of information can be beneficial for cases of languages that have limited resources for machine learning models’ training. With this fusion, we improve the classification accuracy by 4.4499% compared to the models that use only text or only image information. The successful use of the proposed method in scientific documents’ classification paves the way for more complex classification models and more application in other domains such as news classification, sentiment analysis, etc., in the Kazakh language. © 2022 by the authors.","convolutional neural network; document classification; word embedding","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144598844"

Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to investigate the impact of features to obtain high performance. For this purpose, this study analyzes the impact of different subset feature selection techniques on the performance of models for fake news detection. Principal component analysis and Chi-square are investigated for feature selection using machine learning and pre-trained deep learning models. Additionally, the influence of different preprocessing steps is also analyzed regarding fake news detection.

Models tend to yield poor results if no preprocessing or partial processing is carried out. Convolutional neural network, long short term memory network, residual neural network (ResNet), and InceptionV3 show marginally lower performance than the extra tree classifier. Results reveal that using subset features also helps to achieve robustness for machine learning models.  © 2013 IEEE.","Fake news detection; inceptionV3; principal component analysis; ResNet","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139261549"

If we look into the basic meaning of “Fake news”, it refers to inappropriate and made up news. In most cases, the news is made up of baseless sources and facts. These news generally mislead the reader and are generally published for one’s own benefit or to defame others. In recent years, a large population is active on various social media platforms and hence they have become the major medium through which fake news is circulated. A lot of fake news is been circulated in local languages as well. Also most of the existing work is based on the English language and only very little work is done using resource scare language for fake news identification like Indic Languages. So this paper focuses to define false news and suggest an effective method for detecting fake news in Hindi using standard machine learning algorithms like Multi-layer Perceptron and Naive Bayes and deep learning techniques like transforms - mainly mBERT. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

However, in addition to real and useful news, we also receive false and unreal information. The problem of fake news has become a difficult and unresolved issue. For languages with few users, such as Vietnamese, the research on fake news detection is still very limited and has not received much attention. In this paper, we present research results on building a tool to support fake news detection for Vietnamese. Our idea is to apply text classification techniques to fake news detection. We have built a database of 4 groups of 2 topics about politics (fake news and real news) and about Covid-19 (fake news and real news). Then use deep learning techniques CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) to create the corresponding models. When there is new news that needs to be verified, we just need to apply the classification to see which of the four groups they label into to decide whether it is fake news or not. The tool was able to detect fake news quickly and easily with a correct rate of about 85 %. This result will be improved when getting a larger training data set and adjusting the parameters for the machine learning model. These results make an important contribution to the research on detecting fake news for Vietnamese and can be applied to other languages. In the future, besides using classification techniques (based on content analysis), we can combine many other methods such as checking the source, verifying the author's information, checking the distribution process to improve the quality of fake news detection © 2022, Authors.

That is why nearly everything operates in an online mode. Sharing information has also become simple and easy due to the internet and social media. Almost everyone now shares news in the community without even considering the source of information. As a result, there is the issue of disseminating false, misleading, or fabricated data. Detecting fake news is a challenging task because it is presented in such a form that it looks like authentic information. This problem becomes more challenging when it comes to local languages. This paper discusses several deep learning models that utilize LSTM, BiLSTM, CNN+LSTM, and CNN+BiLSTM. On the Hostility detection dataset in Hindi, these models use Word2Vec, IndicNLP fastText, and Facebook's fastText embeddings for fake news detection. The proposed CNN+BiLSTM model with Facebook's fastText embedding achieved an F1-score of 75%, outperforming the baseline model. Additionally, the BiLSTM using Facebook's fastText outperforms CNN+BiLSTM using Facebook's fastText on the F1-score.  © 2022 IEEE.","Deep learning models; Embedding; Fake news; Hindi language; Natural Language Processing","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138496854"

The faster and easier dissemination of information through various means has accelerated the explosive growth of its falsehood. At the same time, the newsfeeds and their credibility in the social networks are in danger since the fake news is alarmingly disseminating very fast. Henceforth, the credibility of the newsfeeds or any information has become a real research challenge to cross-check the respective news or information. The cross verification can be performed concerning its source, the exact content, and the respective publisher to catalog it into fact or fake. Despite a few constraints, machine learning plays a crucial and significant role in classifying the respective news feeds. Various machine learning methodologies such as BLR (Bilinear logistic regression), NB (Naive Bayes), SVM (Support Vector Machine), and RF (Random Forest) have been reviewed and experimented with for detecting the fact and fake news feeds. After the experimentation, the limitations of the respective machine learning methods were explored and noted. Henceforth, a deep learning method called BERT is implemented and it is observed that BERT provides better efficiency than the machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, it is ascertained that the deep learning method provided the best accuracy of 99.79 % with the available dataset. © 2022. School of Science, IHU.

However, due to lack of editorial scrutiny and monitoring by the media authorities, the news distribution has been seriously abused leading to the fast spreading of fake news. Fake news involves misleading broadcasting of information from sources that target to intentionally manipulate the way how people view some events or statements. This study seeks to develop a fake news detection model which will be able to analyze the title and text information attached to the news articles. From the researches done by previous scholars, it showed that the models did not perform very well because of the lack of sufficient feature extraction and fine tuning of the classification of the text. This research will therefore, articulate the gap by employing 5L-CNN deep learning model which will use inbuilt tokenizers for word embedding and will show better accuracy compared to the traditional machine learning models. In this paper, we compare machine learning algorithms (Decision trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression & Naive Bayes) and deep learning algorithms (RNN, 5L-CNN & LSTM) to classify the authenticity of news articles.

A major security issue in social media is the existence of fake accounts. It is a phenomenon that has fake accounts that can be frequently utilized by mischievous users and entities, which falsify, distribute, and duplicate fake news and publicity. As the fake news resulted in serious consequences, numerous research works have focused on the design of automated fake accounts and fake news detection models. In this aspect, this study designs a hyperparameter tuned deep learning based automated fake news detection (HDL-FND) technique. The presented HDL-FND technique accomplishes the effective detection and classification of fake news. Besides, the HDLFND process encompasses a three stage process namely preprocessing, feature extraction, and Bi-Directional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) based classification. The correct way of demonstrating the promising performance of the HDL-FND technique, a sequence of replications were performed on the available Kaggle dataset.

Fake news on social media and various other media is widely spreading. It is a matter of serious concern due to its ability to cause a lot of social and national damage with destructive impacts. Therefore, detecting misleading news is critical to detect automatically. Fake news detection software has been used in a variety of fields, such as social media, health, political news, etc. This paper presents the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (Mexico) at CheckThat! 2022. In this paper, we discuss using different algorithms for the multiclass and cross-lingual fake news detection task. We achieved a macro F1-score of 28.60% for a mono-lingual task in English (task 3a) using RoBERTa pre-trained model and 17.21% for a cross-lingual task for English and German (task 3b) using Bi-LSTM deep learning algorithm. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Cross-lingual classification; Fake news detection; Fake news detection for low resource languages; Multi-class detection; Transfer learning","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136985613"

This major challenge of the connected and modern world can cause many severe and real damages such as manipulating public opinion, damaging reputations, contributing to the loss in stock market value and representing many risks to the global health. With the fast spreading of online misinformation, checking manually Fake News becomes ineffective solution (not obvious, difficult and takes a long time). The improvement of Deep Learning Networks (DLN) can support with high degree of accuracy and efficiency the classical processes of Fake News spotting. One of the keys improvement strategies are optimizing the Word Embedding Layer (WEL) and finding relevant Fake News predicting features. In this context, and based on six DLN architectures, FastText process as WEL and Inverted Pyramid as News Articles Pattern (IPP), the present paper focuses on the assessment of the first news article feature that is hypothesized as affecting the performances of fake news predicting: News Title. By assessing the impact that the Embedding Vector Size (EVS), Window Size (WS) and Minimum Frequency of Words (MFW) in News Titles corpus can have on DLN, the experiments carried out in this paper showed that the News Title feature and FastText process can have a significant improvement on DLN fake news detection with accuracy rates exceeding 98% © 2022, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

By fully leveraging the news social context, URL propagation paths in social networks are first represented as graphs and then classified using Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. Despite these remarkable efforts, researchers are still hampered by the scarcity of high-quality benchmark datasets, and as a result, the efficacy of state-of-the-art approaches could be overestimated. So far, in order to obtain a decent number of third-party fact-checked URLs, researchers have either sampled news from notoriously reliable and unreliable sources using distant supervision, or they have gathered pre-labeled URLs from third-party fact-checking websites. In the former case, resulting datasets can be quite large, but also noisy and biased since pieces of news are labeled as true or false according to their source label, and not individually fact-checked. In the latter case, assigned labels are more reliable, but the included news articles are usually in a single language and they may reflect unknown editorial decisions. As a result, datasets of the latter type are typically small, homogeneous, and thus unrealistically easy for automatic fake news detection models. In this work, we present FbMultiLingMisinfo, a new multilingual benchmark dataset, aimed at a more realistic evaluation of state-of-the-art misinformation detection models. URLs in our dataset come from the Facebook Privacy-Protected Full URLs Data Set, which we augmented with their propagation paths on Twitter. Our experimental results show that, when GNN-based models are tested on FbMultiLingMisinfo, recent misinformation detection results are only partially confirmed. We further show that a sharp reduction in the training size significantly reduces the model accuracy on FbMultiLingMisinfo, but not on two other widely used benchmark datasets for fake news detection. © 2022 IEEE.","disinformation; fact-checking; factuality; fake news; Misinformation","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140803231"

There exist some fake news detection methods that focus on information exploration and utilization from multiple modalities, e.g., text and image. However, how to effectively learn both modality-invariant and event-invariant discriminant features is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Modality and Event Adversarial Networks (MEAN) for fake news detection. It contains two parts: a multi-modal generator and a dual discriminator. The multi-modal generator extracts latent discriminant feature representations of text and image modalities. A decoder is adopted to reduce information loss in the generation process for each modality. The dual discriminator includes a modality discriminator and an event discriminator. The discriminator learns to classify the event or the modality of features, and network training is guided by the adversarial scheme. Experiments on two widely used datasets show that MEAN can perform better than state-of-the-art related multi-modal fake news detection methods.  © 1994-2012 IEEE.","Dual discriminator; fake news detection; multi-modal generator","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132731947"

Fake news is readily manufactured and transmitted across numerous social media platforms nowadays, and it has a significant influence on the real world. It is vital to create effective algorithms and tools for detecting misleading information on social media platforms. Most modern research approaches for identifying fraudulent information are based on machine learning, deep learning, feature engineering, graph mining, image and video analysis, and newly built datasets and online services. There is a pressing need to develop a viable approach for readily detecting misleading information. The deep learning LSTM and Bi-LSTM model was proposed as a method for detecting fake news, In this work. First, the NLTK toolkit was used to remove stop words, punctuation, and special characters from the text. The same toolset is used to tokenize and preprocess the text. Since then, GLOVE word embeddings have incorporated higher-level characteristics of the input text extracted from long-term relationships between word sequences captured by the RNN-LSTM, Bi-LSTM model to the preprocessed text. The proposed model additionally employs dropout technology with Dense layers to improve the model's efficiency. The proposed RNN Bi-LSTM-based technique obtains the best accuracy of 94%, and 93% using the Adam optimizer and the Binary cross-entropy loss function with Dropout (0.1,0.2), Once the Dropout range increases it decreases the accuracy of the model as it goes 92% once Dropout (0.3).  © 2022 IEEE.","Bi-LSTM; Deep learning; Fake news; LSTM; Neural Network; RNN","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149124538"

Although using these mediums has facilitated the speed of accessing information, it also created a new phenomenon used for propaganda and disinformation: fake news. As fake news has detrimental consequences to society, new technologies need to be developed in order to stop their harmful effects. In this paper, we propose two Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) architectures with sentence transformers to solve two tasks: (1) a multi-class mono-lingual fake news detection task (i.e., mono-lingual task); and (2) a multi-class cross-lingual fake news detection task (i.e., cross-lingual task). For the mono-lingual task, we train and test a BiLSTM with BART sentence transformers model on an English dataset and obtain an accuracy of ∼ 0.53 and an F1-Score of ∼ 0.32. For the cross-lingual task, we train a BiLSTM with XLM sentence transformers model on an English dataset and test the model using transfer learning on a German dataset. For this task, we obtain an accuracy of ∼ 0.28 and an F1-Score of ∼ 0.19. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Fake News Detection; Neural Networks; Sentence Transformers; Transfer Learning","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137003249"

Consequently, there is a need to develop novel fake news detection approaches capable of adapting to changing factual contexts and generalizing previously or concurrently acquired knowledge. To deal with this problem, we propose a ensemble-based approach, which allows for fake news detection in multiple languages and the mutual transfer of knowledge acquired in each of them. Both classical feature extractors, such as Term frequency-inverse document frequency or Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and integrated deep NLP (Natural Language Processing) BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) models paired with MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) classifier, were employed. The results of experiments conducted on two datasets dedicated to the fake news classification t ask ( in English and Spanish, respectively), supported by statistical analysis, confirmed that utilization of additional languages could improve performance for traditional methods. Also, in some cases supplementing the deep learning method with classical ones can positively impact obtained results. The ability of models to generalize the knowledge acquired between the analyzed languages was also observed. © 2022 IEEE.","BERT; bidirectional encoder; classifier ensemble; natural language processing; representation learning; transformers","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147956163"

At most of the times, the intention of fake news is to misinform the people and make manipulated societal insights. The spread of low-quality news in social networking sites has a negative influence upon people as well as the society. In order to overcome the ever-increasing dissemination of fake news, automated detection models are developed using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods. The latest advancements in Deep Learning (DL) models and complex Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks make the former, a significant solution to achieve Fake News Detection (FND). In this background, the current study focuses on design and development of Natural Language Processing with Sea Turtle Foraging Optimization-based Deep Learning Technique for Fake News Detection and Classification (STODL-FNDC) model. The aim of the proposed STODL-FNDC model is to discriminate fake news from legitimate news in an effectual manner. In the proposed STODL-FNDC model, the input data primarily undergoes pre-processing and Glove-based word embedding. Besides, STODL-FNDC model employs Deep Belief Network (DBN) approach for detection as well as classification of fake news. Finally, STO algorithm is utilized after adjusting the hyperparameters involved in DBN model, in an optimal manner. The novelty of the study lies in the design of STO algorithm with DBN model for FND. In order to improve the detection performance of STODL-FNDC technique, a series of simulations was carried out on benchmark datasets. The experimental outcomes established the better performance of STODL-FNDC approach over other methods with a maximum accuracy of 95.50%. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Despite various fact-checking websites such as PolitiFact, robust detection techniques are required to deal with the increase in fake news. Several deep learning models show promising results for fake news classification, however, their black-box nature makes it difficult to explain their classification decisions and quality-assure the models. We here address this problem by proposing a novel interpretable fake news detection framework based on the recently introduced Tsetlin Machine (TM). In brief, we utilize the conjunctive clauses of the TM to capture lexical and semantic properties of both true and fake news text. Further, we use clause ensembles to calculate the credibility of fake news. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on two publicly available datasets, PolitiFact and GossipCop, and demonstrate that the TM framework significantly outperforms previously published baselines by at least 5% in terms of accuracy, with the added benefit of an interpretable logic-based representation. In addition, our approach provides a higher F1-score than BERT and XLNet, however, we obtain slightly lower accuracy.

Several researchers have made substantial efforts to automatically identify fake news articles based on linguistic features and neural network-based methods. However, automatic classification via machine and deep learning techniques demands a significant amount of annotated data. While several state-of-the-art datasets for the English language are available and commonly utilized for research, fake news detection in low-resource languages gained less attention. This study surveys the publicly available datasets of fake news in low/medium-resourced Asian and European languages. We also highlight the vacuum of datasets and methods in these languages. Moreover, we summarize the proposed methods and the metrics used to evaluate the classifiers in identifying fake news. This study is helpful for analysis of the available sources in the lower resource languages to solve fake news detection challenges. © 2022, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

People are creating and sharing more information than ever before around the world. Being provided by unreliable sources, some news can be misleading. In fact, the assessment of the correctness of the news can be region related. In other words, news can be true in a specific region while fake in another. Existing proposed solutions for fake news detection developed in centralized platforms are not considering the location from where the news gets announced, but they are focused more on the news content. In this paper, a region-based distributed fake news detection framework is proposed. The framework is deployed in a mobile crowdsensing (MCS) environment where a set of workers responsible for collecting news are selected based on their availability in a specific region. The selected workers share the news to the nearest edge node, where the pre-processing and detection of fake news are executed locally.

With the advancement of technology, electronic content has become more significant and extensively used than ever before, resulting in a revival in the spurious news as well as tweets that seek quick attention. It is critical to achieve early detection and identification of misinformation in social media. In these difficult times of COVID-19 where the whole world is fighting a global pandemic, it is very important to provide people with genuine news and updates about the prevailing situation. The Twitter is flooded with tweets about COVID-19 and related news, but not all the information is factual and full of veracity. To classify this issue, a Deep Learning model is being proposed to classify misinformation about COVID-19 and related news. Pre-trained state-of-the-art GloVe model was used in the proposed method for converting tokens into vectors.

Low cost, simple accessibility via social platforms, and a plethora of low-budget online news sources are some of the factors that contribute to the spread of false news. Most of the existing fake news detection algorithms are solely focused on the news content only but engaged users' prior posts or social activities provide a wealth of information about their views on news and have significant ability to improve fake news identification. Graph Neural Networks are a form of deep learning approach that conducts prediction on graph-described data. Social media platforms are followed graph structure in their representation, Graph Neural Network are special types of neural networks that could be usually applied to graphs, making it much easier to execute edge, node and graph-level prediction. Therefore, in this paper, we present a comparative analysis among some commonly used machine learning algorithms and Graph Neural Networks for detecting the spread of false news on social media platforms. In this study, we take the UPFD dataset and implement several existing machine learning algorithms on text data only. Besides this, we create different GNN layers for fusing graph-structured news propagation data and the text data as the node feature in our GNN models. GNNs provide the best solutions to the dilemma of identifying false news in our research.  © 2022 IEEE.","Fake news detection; GNN; Graph Neural Network; Social media analysis; Text classification","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127881783"

However, in reality, data annotation is labor-intensive and expensive. This work proposes a novel approach for fake news detection by perceiving narrative style with deep learning to alleviate the problem. Deep-learning-based features are represented as embedding vectors. Traditional embedding vectors ingest word context information, but the training requires considerable annotated datasets. Many linguistics studies have shown that written styles, such as the usage of punctuation, repetition of words, and grammatical order, are significant for distinguishing fake news. Our model takes advantage of the word-to-word dependency relationship, describing the styles of the news utterances. We denote the proposed model as Syntax Graphical Thread (SGT) network. We utilize a trainable randomly initialized embedding and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layer to capture the context vector, while a Graph Attention (GAT) layer is used to capture the narrative features. The experimental result manifests that our method can significantly mitigate the reliance on data scale and present better classification results when the dataset is limited. © 2021 IEEE.","Dependency Parsing; Fake News Detection; Gate Recurrent Unit; Graph Attention Network","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132392361"

To address this issue, previous studies mainly utilized single information, the news content, to detect fake news. However, using only news content in training is insufficient. Moreover, most studies did not consider the propagation aspect of fake news as a training feature. Thus, in an attempt to incorporate the ability to learn representation based on textual information and social context, this study proposed a fake news detection algorithm that thoroughly utilizes user graph in Korean fake news and dataset construction methods. In addition, a training strategy was proposed for utilizing user graph in Korean fake news detection through comparative and ablation studies. The experimental results showed that K-FANG outperformed the baseline in detecting fake news. Moreover, user engagements were found to be useful for detecting fake news even if the data contained hate speech. Finally, the validity of using stance information by expanding its class and controlling the class imbalance issues was also verified.

Since much fake news is deliberately fabricated by malicious users or generated by adversarial deep learning models, content-only approaches can not detect fake news effectively. Compared to texts, the propagation patterns of fake news are much harder to be forged. Recent work found that the 'context' of news, the tree-structured graph representing the propagation relationship of news and Twitter posts, is vital for fake news detection. Some work utilize graph neural networks to learn the representation of news' context graphs, achieving stunning performance. However, these methods still suffer from two problems. Firstly, Twitters posts in the context of news are not equally important for fake news detection. However, most previous works treat them equally. Moreover, the context of news presents diverse structures such as 'star-shaped' graphs, with many nodes interacting with a central node, or 'line-shaped' graphs, with sparse connections among neighbors. With single-scale graph representation, previous work can not handle diverse structures well. We propose a novel diversity-aware context attention network to cope with these problems. A context attention pooling function is proposed to extract the critical information within the context. It utilizes an attention module to automatically assign a greater weight to those important posts and a smaller weight to helpless posts. Furthermore, jump knowledge, which concatenates the pooling result from multiple network layers, is adopted. It offers the model multi-scale receptive fields and better adapts to diverse structures. Extensive experiments are conducted under various dataset settings, which confirms the superiority of our approaches over state-of-the-art models. © 2022 IEEE.","Fake News Detection; Graph Neural Network","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140718045"

People rely on news/information posted on their favorite social media sites to make purchase decisions. Also, news posted on mainstream and social media platforms has a significant impact on a particular country's economic stability and social tranquility. Therefore, there is a need to develop a deceptive system that evaluates the news to avoid the repercussions resulting from the rapid dispersion of fake news on social media platforms and other online platforms. To achieve this, the proposed system uses the preprocessing stage results to assign specific vectors to words. Each vector assigned to a word represents an intrinsic characteristic of the word.

To dissect content patterns in the training data, we made use of topic modeling. Topic modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are unsupervised algorithms that pick up on patterns and provide an estimate of what the messages convey. In order to assign class labels to the given documents, we opted for RoBERTa (A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) and Longformer as neural network architectures for sequence classification. Starting off with a pre-trained model for language representation, we fine-tuned this model on the given classification task with the provided annotated data in supervised training steps.

The extensive spread of engineered news with intentionally false information has been observed over the past few years. Consequently, fake news detection has emerged as an important research area. Fake news detection in the Urdu language spoken by more than 230 million people has not been investigated very well. This study analyzes the use and efficacy of various machine learning classifiers along with a deep learning model to detect fake news in the Urdu language. Logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest (RF), naive Bayes, gradient boosting, and passive aggression have been utilized to this end. The influence of term frequencyinverse document frequency and BoW features has also been investigated. For experiments, a manually collected dataset that contains 900 news articles was used. Results suggest that RF performs better and achieves the highest accuracy of 0.92 for Urdu fake news with BoW features.

However, because user-generated content is unregulated, it may contain offensive content such as fake news, insults, and harassment phrases. The identification of fake news and rumors and their dissemination on social media has become a critical requirement. They have adverse effects on users, businesses, enterprises, and even political regimes and governments. State of the art has tackled the English language for news and used feature-based algorithms. This paper proposes a model architecture to detect fake news in the Arabic language by using only textual features.Machine learning and deep learning algorithms were used. The deep learning models are used depending on conventional neural nets (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), CNN+LSTM, and CNN + BiLSTM. Three datasets were used in the experiments, each containing the textual content of Arabic news articles; one of them is reallife data.

A major security issue in this network is the creation of fake accounts. In addition, the automatic classification of the text article as true or fake is also a crucial process. The ineffectiveness of humans in distinguishing the true and false information exposes the fake news as a risk to credibility, democracy, logical truth, and journalism in government sectors. Besides, the automatic fake news or rumors from the social networking sites is a major research area in the field of social media analytics. With this motivation, this paper develops a new reliable deep learning (DL) based fake account and fake news detection (RDL-FAFND) model for the social networking sites. The goal of the RDL-FAFND model is to resolve the major problems involved in the social media platforms namely fake accounts, fake news/rumor identification. The presented RDL-FAFND model detects the fake account by the use of a parameter tuned deep stacked Auto encoder (DSAE) using the krill herd (KH) optimization algorithm for detecting the fake social networking accounts. Besides, the presented RDL-FAFND model involves an ensemble of the machine learning (ML) models with different linguistic features (EML-LF) for categorizing the text as true or fake. An extensive set of experiments have been carried out for highlighting the superior performance of the RDL-FAFND model. A detailed comparative results analysis has stated that the presented RDL-FAFND model is considerably better than the existing methods. © 2022, Tech Science Press.

The recent event of Hong Kong protests triggered an outburst of fake news posts that were identified on Twitter, which were then promptly removed and compiled into datasets to promote research. These datasets focusing on linguistic content were used in previous work to classify between tweets spreading fake and real news using traditional machine learning algorithms (Zervopoulos et al., in: IFIP international conference on artificial intelligence applications and innovations, Springer, Berlin, 2020). In this paper, the experimentation process on the previously constructed dataset is extended using deep learning algorithms along with a diverse set of input features, ranging from raw text to handcrafted features. Experiments showed that the deep learning algorithms outperformed the traditional approaches, reaching scores as high as 99.3% F1 Score, with the multilingual state-of-the-art model XLM-RoBERTa outperforming other algorithms using raw untranslated text. The combination of both traditional and deep learning algorithms allows for increased performance through the latter, while also gaining insight regarding tweet structure from the interpretability of the former. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Fake news detection; Hong Kong protests; Long short-term memory; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Twitter; XLM-RoBERTa","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109339425"

Although most fake news detection systems have been developed for English, it is a primitive stage concerning low-resource languages, especially Bengali. Fake news sometimes floods the virtual m edia, making it arduous to process and classify them manually. Thus, an automated system can be a good solution for detecting fake news with less time and cost. This paper introduces a framework (named FaND-X) for fake news detection by exploiting transformer-based and neural network-based approaches. This research also developed a dataset (called BFNC) consisting of 5K fake news data. In the experimentation, five machine learning (LR, RF, MNB, SVM, DT), three deep neural networks (CNN, BiLSTM, CNN+BiLSTM), and three transformer-based approaches (Bangla-BERT, m-BERT, XLM-R) were applied for the fake news classification t ask.

Unfortunately, such sophisticated Deep Learning methods often require intense computational efforts for training.

The Network sites/apps, such as WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, are essential information sources due to their vast user bases. Social networking platforms provide hands-on connectivity with others and ease of use to the down-market that radio and television broadcasters are unable to provide - multi-way communication. By modifying the original content or a full parody presented as fact, negative influencers can take advantage of the freedom provided by social networks and wilfully spread any misinformation. The spread of false information can happen in the blink of an eye, potentially deceiving the general public and spreading to other communities. Despite this awareness, social media platforms continue to spread dubious material. Even though many of them are still passed off as fact, hoaxes continue to be a major problem.

Misinformation related to the vaccines, remedies, false symptoms, etc. are spiraling out of control. We might not be able to directly put a stop to the flow or spread of fake news to a large extent at the moment, but it may be able to identify it as such with the help of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. Steps involved in achieving this goal can be narrowed down into collection and analysis of data from various sources, sorting out the articles as covid-relevant and categorizing them as real or fake using DL models. However, DL models use different optimizers in the learning process, which plays an important role in identifying the fake news. This chapter also compares the efficiency of different optimizers in the context of COVID-19 fake news detection using DL models. The newly developed Continuous Coin Betting (CoCoB) Optimizer for DL studied extensively for fake news detection and performed compared with four other widely used optimizers.

These fake news reports lead individuals to believe in false and sometimes harmful claims and stories, and they also influence people's vaccination opinions. Immediately detecting COVID-19 false news can help to reduce the spread of fear, confusion, and potential health risks among citizens. An ensemble-based deep learning model for detecting COVID-19-related fake news on Twitter is proposed in this article. CT-BERT, BERTweet, and roberta are three different models that are fine-tuned on COVID-19-linked text data to separate fake and authentic news. In addition, the proposed ensemble-based model is compared to a variety of standard machine learning and deep learning models. In the detection of COVID-19 fake news from Twitter, the proposed ensemble-based deep learning model achieved state-of-the-art performance with a weighted $F_1$F1-score of 0.99.  © 1999-2012 IEEE.","","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130638937"

These sources can easily spread fake news for several malicious reasons. Detecting this unreliable news is an important task in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field. Many governments and technology companies are engaged in this research field to prevent the manipulation of public opinion and spare people and society the huge damage that can result from the spreading of misleading information on online social media. In this paper, we present a new deep learning method to detect fake news based on a combination of different word embedding techniques and a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BILSTM) model.

Fake news distribution can lead to political unrest, social disrupt and economic loss. With different modes of information being spread, it has become a challenge for researchers to distinguish between genuine and fake content. Literature shows that most of the work done in automatic detection of fake news either focuses on textual content or visual content independently. While both types come with their inherent challenges, there is a greater challenge of identifying fake content when it is presented in a multi-modal form. In this research, we propose a deep learning-based framework for multi-modal fake content identification that aims to determine the correlation between the textual and visual data to assess the validity of the news content. For textual feature representation, we employ a light variant of Bidirectional Encoder Representation Transformer architecture with four encoder layers and eight attention heads. For the visual representation, we use a pre-trained EfficientB1 architecture. The feature representations from both networks are then fused by concatenation to train a Multi- layer perceptron network. The proposed framework is evaluated using a benchmark dataset in three scenarios, i.e. two-class (fake/no fake), three-class (fake/no fake/partially related) and six- class (related/satire/misleading/imposter/false/manipulated) problem. Our proposed methodology achieved promising results in all the three scenarios with highest accuracy of 90.33% in two-class, 89.48% accuracy in three-class, and 87.10% accuracy in six-class scenario.  © 2022 IEEE.","BERT; Effi- cientB1; Fake news detection; multi-modal","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146490474"

Most of them focus on the classification method. These methods have accuracy problems and fail to perform well on diverse datasets due to the lack of a generalized feature extraction method. This study aims to enhance the score of the fake news identification model with a generalized and robust feature extraction method to handle the above problems. This study uses a popular fake news dataset, which is available in the Kaggle. The proposed approach uses Stemming that helps to convert all the words into their corresponding root word. Then TF-IDF and BERT convert all the texts into a feature vector for machine learning (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Passive Aggressive, K-means, K-medoids, and K-nearest neighbor) and deep learning (BERT), respectively. Performance analysis shows that BERT with the stemming Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique outperforms all the previous methods and achieves an accuracy of 99.74%. The previous state-of-The-Art method (fakeBERT) has shown an accuracy of 98.90%. The primary reason for this performance gain is the stemming, which transforms all words in a sentence to their root word, resulting in a generalized vector that aids the model performance. On the other hand, the support vector machine (linear kernel) and passive-Aggressive classifier method with stemming TF-IDF vectorizer also outperforms all the aforementioned approaches with the accuracy of 99.11% and 98.99%.  © 2022 IEEE.","data analysis; deep learning; fake news; machine learning; misinformation","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146913929"

This article finds that the accuracy of the GCN method for fake news detection is basically about 85% through comparison with other neural network models, which is satisfactory, and proposes that the current field lacks a unified training dataset, and that in the future fake news detection models should focus more on semi-supervised learning and unsupervised learning. © 2022 IEEE.","CNN; deep learning; fake news; GCN","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146372394"

However, news portals sometimes abuse press freedom by manipulating facts. Most of the time, people are unable to discriminate between true and false news. It is difficult to avoid the detrimental impact of Bangla fake news from spreading quickly through online channels and influencing people's judgment. In this work, we investigated many real and false news pieces in Bangla to discover a common pattern for determining if an article is disseminating incorrect information or not. We developed a deep learning model that was trained and validated on our selected dataset. For learning, the dataset contains 48,678 legitimate news and 1,299 fraudulent news. To deal with the imbalanced data, we used random undersampling and then ensemble to achieve the combined output.

Intentional misleading news may promote negative online experiences and influence societal behavioral changes such as increased anxiety, loneliness, and inadequacy. Adversarial attacks target creating misinformation in online information systems. This behavior can be viewed as an instrument to manipulate the online social media networks for cultural, social, economic, and political gains. A method to test a deep learning model- long short-term memory (LSTM) using adversarial examples generated from a transformer model has been presented. The paper attempts to examine features in machine learning algorithms that propagate fake news. Another goal is to evaluate and compare the usefulness of generative adversarial networks with long-term short-term recurrent neural network algorithms in identifying fake news. A closer look at the mechanisms of implementing adversarial attacks in social media systems helps build robust intelligent systems that can withstand future vulnerabilities. © 2022 IEEE Computer Society.

A large number of fake news detection(FND) techniques rely on text analysis and very little attention has been paid to visual content-based detection. Deep learning-based generative models have increased the complexity by creating ultra-realistic phony media content and most detection techniques fail when dealing with such synthesized media. Therefore, the paper surveys the vision-based FND and improves our understanding of the role of visual content in detection. At the same time, it is important to study propagation characteristics and find an impact analysis of fake news. The existing review papers do not combine two parts - detection and impact analysis.

Due to this many incidents have occurred that show how false news can have detrimental effect on the people and hence it becomes imperative to check the credibility of online news articles. Platforms like Facebook and Twitter have also taken multiple initiatives in past years to check the spread of misleading content on their platforms. Researchers have been continuously working on providing solutions to tackle the issue of fake news and its implications. This paper focuses on the Content-Based Fake News Detection (FND) which deploys text-based and visual-based approaches. In the past few years, a more sophisticated approach i.e the Multimodal approach is being used that combines the features of textual and visual data. This paper highlights various techniques for content-based FND using Deep Learning (DL) approach. These deep learning models and frameworks have been analyzed in detail and the results depict that there is a considerable improvement in the overall performance when the multimodal methods are used. Also, various techniques that might help for improving the efficiency of the FND frameworks are also included as future directions. This paper also presents numerous challenges that a researcher may encounter while modelling a FND framework and provides probable solution that might be applicable to overcome these challenges.  © 2022 IEEE.","Content-based; Deep Fake; Deep learning; Fake news detection; Image tempering; Multimodal","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141703952"

Existing approaches for misinformation detection use neural network models, statistical methods, linguistic traits, fact-checking strategies, etc. However, the menace of fake news seems to grow more vigorous with the advent of humongous and unusually creative language models. Relevant literature reveals that one major characteristic of the virality of fake news is the presence of an element of surprise in the story, which attracts immediate attention and invokes strong emotional stimulus in the reader. In this work, we leverage this idea and propose textual novelty detection and emotion prediction as the two tasks relating to automatic misinformation detection. We re-purpose textual entailment for novelty detection and use the models trained on large-scale datasets of entailment and emotion to classify fake information. Our results correlate with the idea as we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance (7.92%, 1.54%, 17.31% and 8.13% improvement in terms of accuracy) on four large-scale misinformation datasets. We hope that our current probe will motivate the community to explore further research on misinformation detection along this line.

However, the majority of the research focuses on the training of these models using publicly available data collections, mostly containing news articles written in the English language. As the spreading of fake news is a global phenomenon, it is also necessary to explore these approaches on the various local data sources.

In our increasingly digital culture, fake news and misinformation are more common in journalism, news reporting, social media, and other online information consumption platforms. The spread of misinformation can have harmful impacts or even control public events by using multimedia content to deceive readers and gain dissemination. The question here is how to spot fake news about recently occurring events and it is one of the special difficulties in Fake News Detection (FND) on social networking sites. Recent study has considerably increased our ability to identify fake news, because of less emphasis on utilizing the relationship between the textual and visual information in news samples. It is possible to spot fake news by giving importance to similarity among textual and visual features. In this paper, we study the task of identifying fake news using the Fakeddit dataset, which is a collection of full-length articles and related images. We propose a multimodal approach that makes use of transfer learning to gather semantic and contextual data, develop stronger hidden representations between the words in news samples and the images, and tries to improve the accuracy of FND task.

The consumption of online news is one of the important trends as the share of population with internet access grows rapidly over time. Global statistics have shown that the internet and social media usage has an increasing trend. Recent developments like the Covid 19 pandemic have amplified this trend even more. However, the credibility of online news is a very critical issue to consider since it directly impacts the society and the people's mindsets. Majority of users tend to instinctively believe what they encounter and come into conclusions based upon them. It is essential that the consumers have an understanding or prior knowledge regarding the news and its source before coming into conclusions. This research proposes a hybrid model to predict the accuracy of a particular news article in Sinhala text. The model combines the general news content based analysis techniques using machine learning/ deep learning classifiers with social network related features of the news source to make predictions. A scoring mechanism is utilized to provide an overall score to a given news item where two independent scores- Accuracy Score (by analyzing the news content) and Credibility Score (by a scoring mechanism on social network features of the news source) are combined. The hybrid model containing the Passive Aggressive Classifier has shown the highest accuracy of 88%. Also, the models containing deep neural netWorks has shown accuracy around 75-80%. These results highlight that the proposed method could efficiently serve as a Fake News Detection mechanism for news content in Sinhala Language. Also, since there's no publicly available dataset for Fake News detection in Sinhala, the datasets produced in this work could also be considered as a contribution from this research.  © 2022 IEEE.","Fake News; Hybrid Approach; Machine Learning Classifiers; Social Network Meta Data","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147846100"

They allow us to remain in contact with friends regardless of distances, to share posts, images, videos, to be part of communities or come across articles and news. Everything develops so quickly that formality and content are no longer given too much importance. Therefore, it is through the development of these social networks that the need to distinguish fake news from real ones has developed. In this paper, we propose FakeNED a system for the detection of fake news on social networks. It comprises a multimodal Deep Learning (DL) approach of extracting features both from the text and from the images of the article. For the first extraction, we implemented a BERT-based (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) method with an initial pre-trained phase followed by a fine-tuning final phase. For the latter, we used a VGG-16 to develop the image feature extraction. The extracted features were then given as input to a Fully Connected Layer in order to obtain the final output.

After the COVID-19 outbreak, the overabundance of fake information and rumours on online social platforms about the COVID-19 pandemic has spread over society as quickly as the virus itself. As a result, fake news poses a significant threat to effective virus response by negatively affecting people’s willingness to follow the proper public health guidelines and protocols, which makes it important to identify fake information from online platforms for the public interest. In this research, we introduce an approach to detect fake news using deep learning techniques, which outperform traditional machine learning techniques with a 93.1% accuracy. We then investigate the content differences between real and fake news by applying topic modeling and linguistic analysis. Our results show that topics on Politics and Government services are most common in fake news. In addition, we found that fake news has lower analytic and authenticity scores than real news. With the findings, we discuss important academic and practical implications of the study. © 2022,Asia Pacific Journal of Information Systems.All Rights Reserved.","Covid-19; Fake news detection; Infodemic; Linguistic analysis; Machine learning; Topic modeling","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147749479"

Recent works have investigated fake news detection on social platforms in English and Mandarin, though Cantonese fake news has been understudied. To pave the way for Cantonese COVID-19 fake news detection, we first presented an annotated COVID-19 related Cantonese fake news dataset collected from a popular local discussion forum in Hong Kong. Then, we explored the dataset by applying topic modeling to identify the topics that contain the most significant amount of fake news. Moreover, we evaluated both traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms for Cantonese fake news detection.

The search for effective solutions to this problem is still ongoing, and covers different areas of application, from opinion spam to fake news detection. A more recently investigated scenario, despite the serious risks that incurring disinformation could entail, is that of the online dissemination of health information. Early approaches in this area focused primarily on user-based studies applied to Web page content. More recently, automated approaches have been developed for both Web pages and social media content, particularly with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. These approaches are primarily based on handcrafted features extracted from online content in association with Machine Learning. In this scenario, we focus on Web page content, where there is still room for research to study structural-, content- and context-based features to assess the credibility of Web pages.

Its ability to engage users to react to information posted on this media in the form of like, share, and comment made it a preferable information sharing platform by many. But the contents posted on social media are not filtered, fact checked or judged by an editorial body like any traditional news platform. Therefore, individuals, institutions and communities who consume news from social media are vulnerable to misinformation by malicious authors. In this work, we are proposing an approach that detects fake news by investigating the reaction of users to a post composed by malicious authors. Using features extracted by bag-of-words model and TF-IDF from text based replies (comments), and visual emotion responses in the form of categorical data, we built models that predicted news as fake or real. We have designed and conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of our approach. The results show the proposed approach outperforms the baseline in all the six models.

It has resulted in the inaccuracy and irrelevancy in updating information by people which is commonly known as fake news. Due to the increasing number of users in social media, fake news is quickly publishing by an individual, and its credibility stands compromised, which brings in a need for effective detection of fake news. Since a large proportion of the population uses social media for updating themselves with news, delivering accurate and altruistic information to them is of utmost importance. Fake news detection has recently garnered much attention from researchers and developers alike. This work proposes to detect fake news using various modalities available, such as text, image, and text in the image in an effective manner using Deep Learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a deep convolutional neural network for handling diverse multi-domain fake news data.

Thus, it is critical to detect and combat such misinformation. Recently, deep learning models using natural language processing techniques, such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), have achieved great successes in detecting misinformation. In this paper, we proposed an explainable natural language processing model based on DistilBERT and SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) to combat misinformation about COVID-19 due to their efficiency and effectiveness. First, we collected a dataset of 984 claims about COVID-19 with fact-checking. By augmenting the data using back-translation, we doubled the sample size of the dataset and the DistilBERT model was able to obtain good performance (accuracy: 0.972; areas under the curve: 0.993) in detecting misinformation about COVID-19. Our model was also tested on a larger dataset for AAAI2021 — COVID-19 Fake News Detection Shared Task and obtained good performance (accuracy: 0.938; areas under the curve: 0.985). The performance on both datasets was better than traditional machine learning models. Second, in order to boost public trust in model prediction, we employed SHAP to improve model explainability, which was further evaluated using a between-subjects experiment with three conditions, i.e., text (T), text+SHAP explanation (TSE), and text+SHAP explanation+source and evidence (TSESE). The participants were significantly more likely to trust and share information related to COVID-19 in the TSE and TSESE conditions than in the T condition. Our results provided good implications for detecting misinformation about COVID-19 and improving public trust. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","BERT; COVID-19; DistilBERT; Misinformation detection; SHAP; Trust","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102851698"

Since social networking sites have become more frequently utilized for transmitting data, they have also become a gateway for the distribution of fake news for diverse financial and legislative goals. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches have a lot of ability for academics who wish to design models that can recognize fake news automatically. On the other hand, identifying fake news is a difficult issue because it demands systems that describe the news and then contrast it to the actual news to categorize it as fake. Thus, to overcome this, this paper introduces Hybrid Deep Neural Network Model, in which C-DSSM and Deep CNN models have been utilized. It identifies and classifies fake news using the LIAR dataset. According to experimental results, the proposed model obtained an accuracy of 92.60%, a recall of 92.40%, a precision of 92.50%, and an F1 score of 92.50%. Furthermore, the proposed model is compared to earlier studies for fake news identification using the LIAR dataset, and the proposed model's performance is remarkable. As a result, the proposed hybrid model gives better results in detecting and classifying fake news on social networks. © Authors, Science IN.","Convolution; Deep learning; Dis-information; Dynamic Semantic Structural Model; Fake news detection; Misinformation; Rumors","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134520275"

Fake news not only causes serious damage to the credibility of the public media but also damages the rights of the parties. So, it is necessary to detect fake news from both online social media and traditional media. For decades, different approaches for fake news detection have been proposed. And these methods can be categorized into manual detection and automatic detection. In this paper, we make a comprehensive review of automatic fake news detection. We first introduce the definition of fake news and fake news detection. Then, some commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics are demonstrated. Besides, we also revise some deep learning approaches for automatic fake news detection. Finally, we discuss some potential challenges and problems for the future.

Firstly, we compare between the two approaches using different classification algorithms. According to the applied experiments, the classification based on Doc2vec model provided promising results with more than one classifier. The Support vector machine resulted the best accuracy with 95.5% followed by Logistic Regression 94.7% and the Long Short Term Memory produced the lowest accuracy. On the other hand, the classification based Word2vec embedding model results high accuracy only with Long Short Term Memory classifier with 94.3%.

Nowadays, social media platforms have become the ripe grounds for misinformation, spreading them in a few minutes, which led to chaos, panic, and potential health hazards among people. The rapid dissemination and a prolific rise in the spread of fake news and misinformation create the most time-critical challenges for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community. Relevant literature reveals that the presence of an element of surprise in the story is a strong driving force for the rapid dissemination of misinformation, which attracts immediate attention and invokes strong emotional stimulus in the reader. False stories or fake information are written to arouse interest and activate the emotions of people to spread it. Thus, false stories have a higher level of novelty and emotional content than true stories. Hence, Novelty of the news item and recognizing the Emotional state of the reader after reading the item seems two key tasks to tightly couple with misinformation Detection. Previous literature did not explore misinformation detection with mutual learning for novelty detection and emotion recognition to the best of our knowledge. Our current work argues that joint learning of novelty and emotion from the target text makes a strong case for misinformation detection. In this paper, we propose a deep multitask learning framework that jointly performs novelty detection, emotion recognition, and misinformation detection. Our deep multitask model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for fake news detection on four benchmark datasets, viz. ByteDance, FNC, Covid-Stance and FNID with 7.73%, 3.69%, 7.95% and 13.38% accuracy gain, respectively. The evaluation shows that our multitask learning framework improves the performance over the single-task framework for four datasets with 7.8%, 28.62%, 11.46%, and 15.66% overall accuracy gain. We claim that textual novelty and emotion are the two key aspects to consider while developing an automatic fake news detection mechanism.

With the emergence of fake news at a very rapid rate, a serious concern has produced in our society because of enormous fake content dissemination. The quality of the news content is questionable and there exists a necessity for an automated tool for the detection. Existing studies primarily focus on utilizing information extracted from the news content. We suggest that user-based engagements and the context related group of people (echo-chamber) sharing the same opinions can play a vital role in the fake news detection. Hence, in this paper, we have focused on both the content of the news article and the existence of echo chambers in the social network for fake news detection. Standard factorization methods for fake news detection have limited effectiveness due to their unsupervised nature and primarily employed with traditional machine learning models. To design an effective deep learning model with tensor factorization approach is the priority. In our approach, the news content is fused with the tensor following a coupled matrix–tensor factorization method to get a latent representation of both news content as well as social context. We have designed our model with a different number of filters across each dense layer along with dropout. To classify on news content and social context-based information individually as well as in combination, a deep neural network (our proposed model) was employed with optimal hyper-parameters. The performance of our proposed approach has been validated on a real-world fake news dataset: BuzzFeed and PolitiFact. Classification results have demonstrated that our proposed model (EchoFakeD) outperforms existing and appropriate baselines for fake news detection and achieved a validation accuracy of 92.30%. These results have shown significant improvements over the existing state-of-the-art models in the area of fake news detection and affirm the potential use of the technique for classifying fake news. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature.","Deep learning; Echo chamber; Fake news; Social media; Tensor decomposition","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098717412"

Fake news detection has become indispensable in modern society because of the extreme propagation of false news on social platforms and news portals. Several studies have been released that use fake news on social platforms instead of news content for decision-making. Therefore, this paper introduces an automated model for detecting fake news relying on Deep Learning (DL) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for a low-resource language like Bangla, utilizing news content and headline features. We propose an ensemble approach of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with a pre-Trained GloVe embedding method that achieved an accuracy of 98.71% on the test data. For comparison, the combination of Long short-Term memory (LSTM) and CNN with Globe is trained using the same dataset and parameters. We also experimented on a benchmark dataset containing English news with our suggested model and achieved an accuracy of 98.94%.

Prior to the internet era, it was mostly distributed through yellow journalism, with a focus on sensational news such as crime, rumours, accidents, and amusing news. To rescue the life of people from these fake news propagation, detection of fake news at an early stage becomes the most crucial step. People unknowingly propagate fake news and become a part of fake news propagation. While the original fake news propagators are the one with their aim to target innocent people for spreading the fake news. To stop this series of events, fake news detection and its pattern of propagation becomes very essential to society and the government. Various techniques exist to detect fake news in social media, among which neural networks have shown effective results. For this research, a deep learning based approach has been used to differentiate false news from the original ones. A LSTM neural network has been used to build the proposed model. Besides the neural network, a gloVe word embedding has been used for vector representation of textual words. Also, for feature extraction or vectorization, tokenization technique has been used. N-grams concept is used to enhance the proposed model. The comparative analysis of multiple fake news detection techniques is analysed.

Fake news and misinformation, due to its peculiarity and rapid dissemination, have posed many interesting challenges to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) community. Admissible literature shows that novel information includes the element of surprise, which is the principal characteristic for the amplification and virality of misinformation. Novel and emotional information attracts immediate attention in the reader. Emotion is the presentation of a certain feeling or sentiment. Sentiment helps an individual to convey his emotion through expression and hence the two are co-related. Thus, Novelty of the news item and thereafter detecting the Emotional state and Sentiment of the reader appear to be three key ingredients, tightly coupled with misinformation. In this paper we propose a deep multitask learning model that jointly performs novelty detection, emotion recognition, sentiment prediction, and misinformation detection. Our proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance for fake news detection on three benchmark datasets, viz. ByteDance, Fake News Challenge(FNC), and Covid-Stance with 11.55%, 1.58%, and 21.76% improvement in accuracy, respectively.

Social media platforms allow us to consume news much faster, with less restricted editing results in the spread of fake news at an incredible pace and scale. In recent researches, many useful methods for fake news detection employ sequential neural networks to encode news content and social context-level information where the text sequence was analyzed in a unidirectional way. Therefore, a bidirectional training approach is a priority for modelling the relevant information of fake news that is capable of improving the classification performance with the ability to capture semantic and long-distance dependencies in sentences. In this paper, we propose a BERT-based (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) deep learning approach (FakeBERT) by combining different parallel blocks of the single-layer deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) having different kernel sizes and filters with the BERT. Such a combination is useful to handle ambiguity, which is the greatest challenge to natural language understanding.

In recent times, Fake news detection has attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners due to its many-fold benefits, including bringing in preventive measures to tackle the dissemination of misinformation that could otherwise disturb the social fabrics. Social media in recent times are heavily loaded with multimedia news and information. People prefer online news reading and find it more informative and convenient if they have access to multimedia content in the forms of text, images, audio, and videos. In early studies, researchers have proposed several fake news detection mechanisms that mostly utilize the textual features and not proper to learn multimodal (textual + visual) shared representation. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a multimodal fake news detection framework with appropriate multimodal feature fusion that leverages information from text and image and tries to maximize the correlation between them to get the efficient multimodal shared representation. We empirically show that text, when combined with the image, can improve the performance of the model. The model detects the post once it is introduced into the network in an early stage. At the early stage of a news post's introduction into the network, the model takes the text and image of the post as input and decides whether this is fake or genuine. Since this model only analyzes news contents, It does not require any prior information regarding the user and network details. This framework has four different sub-modules viz. Attention Based Stacked Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (ABS-BiLSTM) for textual feature representation, Attention Based Multilevel Convolutional Neural Network–Recurrent Neural Network (ABM-CNN–RNN) for visual feature extraction, multimodal Factorized Bilinear Pooling (MFB) for feature fusion and finally Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the classification. We perform experiments on two publicly available datasets, viz. Twitter and Weibo. Evaluation results show the efficacy of our proposed approach that performs significantly better compared to the state-of-the-art models. It shows to outperform the current state-of-the-art by approximately 10 points for the Twitter dataset. In contrast, the Weibo dataset achieves an overall better performance with balanced F1-scores between fake and real classes. Furthermore, the complexity of our proposed model is significantly lower than the state-of-the-art. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Attention mechanism; Deep learning; Multimodal Factorized Bilinear Pooling; Multimodal fake news detection; Multimodal Feature fusion","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109215869"

The architecture factors in the discourse structure of news in traditional digital media and is based on two premises. First, fake news tends to mix true and false information with the purpose of confusing readers. Second, this research is focused on fake news delivered in traditional digital media, so our approach considers the influence of the journalistic structure of news, and the way journalists tend to introduce the essential content in a news story using 5W1H answer. Considering both premises, this proposal deals with the news components separately because some may be true or false, instead of considering the veracity value of the news article as a unit. A two-layer architecture is proposed, Structure and Veracity layers. To demonstrate the validity of the proposal, a new dataset was created and annotated with a new fine-grained annotation scheme (FNDeepML) that considers the different elements of the news document and their veracity. Due to the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, health is the chosen domain, and Spanish is the language used to validate the architecture, given the lack of research in this language. However, the proposal can be applied to any other language or domain. The performance of the Veracity layer of our proposal, which factors in the traditional news article structure and the 5W1H annotation, is capable of delivering a result of F1=0.807. This represents a strong improvement when compared to the baseline, which uses the whole document with a single veracity value, obtaining F1=0.605.

Some fake news are so similar to the real ones that it is difficult for human to identify them. Therefore, automated fake news detection tools like machine learning and deep learning models have become an essential requirement. In this paper, we evaluated the performance of five machine learning models and three deep learning models on two fake and real news datasets of different size with hold out cross validation. We also used term frequency, term frequency-inverse document frequency and embedding techniques to obtain text representation for machine learning and deep learning models respectively. To evaluate models' performance, we used accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score as the evaluation metrics and a corrected version of McNemar's test to determine if models' performance is significantly different. Then, we proposed our novel stacking model which achieved testing accuracy of 99.94% and 96.05 % respectively on the ISOT dataset and KDnugget dataset. Furthermore, the performance of our proposed method is high as compared to baseline methods.

To date, many approaches have been proposed to detect fake news, which includes traditional learning methods and deep learning-based models. However, there are three existing challenges: (i) How to represent social media posts effectively, since the post content is various and highly complicated; (ii) how to propose a data-driven method to increase the flexibility of the model to deal with the samples in different contexts and news backgrounds; and (iii) how to fully utilize the additional auxiliary information (the background knowledge and multi-modal information) of posts for better representation learning. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a novel Knowledge-aware Multi-modal Adaptive Graph Convolutional Networks (KMAGCN) to capture the semantic representations by jointly modeling the textual information, knowledge concepts, and visual information into a unified framework for fake news detection. We model posts as graphs and use a knowledge-aware multi-modal adaptive graph learning principal for the effective feature learning. Compared with existing methods, the proposed KMAGCN addresses challenges from three aspects: (1) It models posts as graphs to capture the non-consecutive and long-range semantic relations; (2) it proposes a novel adaptive graph convolutional network to handle the variability of graph data; and (3) it leverages textual information, knowledge concepts and visual information jointly for model learning. We have conducted extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets and superior results demonstrate the effectiveness of KMAGCN compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","Fake news detection; graph convolutional network; multi-modal learning","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112866928"

With fake news being such a huge issue, efforts should be made to identify any forms of fake news however it is not so simple. Manually identifying fake news can be extremely subjective as determining the accuracy of the information in a story is complex and difficult to perform, even for experts. On the other hand, an automated solution would require a good understanding of NLP which is also complex and may have difficulties producing an accurate output. Therefore, the main problem focused on this project is the viability of developing a system that can effectively and accurately detect and identify fake news. Finding a solution would be a significant benefit to the media industry, particularly the social media industry as this is where a large proportion of fake news is published and spread. In order to find a solution to this problem, this project proposed the development of a fake news identification system using deep learning and natural language processing. The system was developed using a Word2vec model combined with a Long Short-Term Memory model in order to showcase the compatibility of the two models in a whole system. This system was trained and tested using two different dataset collections that each consisted of one real news dataset and one fake news dataset. Furthermore, three independent variables were chosen which were the number of training cycles, data diversity and vector size to analyze the relationship between these variables and the accuracy levels of the system. It was found that these three variables did have a significant effect on the accuracy of the system. From this, the system was then trained and tested with the optimal variables and was able to achieve the minimum expected accuracy level of 90%. The achieving of this accuracy levels confirms the compatibility of the LSTM and Word2vec model and their capability to be synergized into a single system that is able to identify fake news with a high level of accuracy.  © 2022 IEEE.","deep Learning; fake news; natural language processing","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151634795"

Lack of constant supervision has motivated the miscreants to spread fake information. Fake news articles that are planted over digital media shares important linguistic features such as immoderate usage of unconfirmed hyperbole and non-verified quotes. It is necessary to invent an automated mechanism to identify fake news and also to minimize its impact by restricting its spread. This survey comprehensively and systematically studies different methodologies in the detection of fake news in digital media.

Modern methods of detecting fake news rely heavily on textual information, examining the extracted news content or writing style based on internal knowledge. However, intentional rumors can mask the style of writing, bypassing languages and text patterns. In order to combat the spread of fake news, methods of automatic detection based on artificial intelligence and machine learning were studied. In a world where millions of articles are deleted and published every minute, this cannot be done effectively manually.

Social media and websites are flooded with unverified news posts. These posts are comprised of text, images, audio, and videos. There is a requirement for a system that detects fake content in multiple data modalities. We have seen a considerable amount of research on classification techniques for textual fake news detection, while frameworks dedicated to visual fake news detection are very few. We explored the state-of-the-art methods using deep networks such as CNNs and RNNs for multi-modal online information credibility analysis. They show rapid improvement in classification tasks without requiring pre-processing. To aid the ongoing research over fake news detection using CNN models, we build textual and visual modules to analyze their performances over multi-modal datasets. We exploit latent features present inside text and images using layers of convolutions. We see how well these convolutional neural networks perform classification when provided with only latent features and analyze what type of images are needed to be fed to perform efficient fake news detection. We propose a multi-modal Coupled ConvNet architecture that fuses both the data modules and efficiently classifies online news depending on its textual and visual content. We thence offer a comparative analysis of the results of all the models utilized over three datasets. The proposed architecture outperforms various state-of-the-art methods for fake news detection with considerably high accuracies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Fake news detection; Multimodal combination; Weighted average fusion","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103349430"

The world's preeminent decisions such as politics are acclaimed by social media to influence users for enclosing users' decisions in their favor. However, the adoption of social media is much needed for awareness but the authenticity of content is an unknown factor in the current scenario. Therefore, this research work finds it imperative to propose a solution to fake news detection and classification. In the case of fake news, content is the prime entity that captures the human mind towards trust for specific news. Therefore, a linguistic model is proposed to find out the properties of content that will generate language-driven features. This linguistic model extracts syntactic, grammatical, sentimental, and readability features of particular news. Language driven model requires an approach to handle time-consuming and handcrafted features problems in order to deal with the curse of dimensionality problem. Therefore, the neural-based sequential learning model is used to achieve superior results for fake news detection. The results are drawn to validate the importance of the linguistic model extracted features and finally combined linguistic feature-driven model is able to achieve the average accuracy of 86% for fake news detection and classification. The sequential neural model results are compared with machine learning based models and LSTM based word embedding based fake news detection model as well. Comparative results show that features based sequential model is able to achieve comparable evaluation performance in discernable less time. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; Fake news; LSTM; Machine learning; Neural network; Readability; Syntactic","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098453070"

Thus, many scholars have been researching automatic fake news detection based on artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) to prevent the spread of fake news. The mainstream research on detecting fake news so far has been text-based detection approaches, but they have inherent limitations such as the difficulty of short text processing and language dependency. Thus, as an alternative to the text-based approach, the context-based approach is emerging. The most common context-based approach the use of distributors’ network information in social media. However, such information is difficult to obtain, and only propagation within a single social media can be traced. Under this background, we propose the use of composition pattern of web links containing news content as a new source of information for fake news detection. To properly vectorize the composition pattern of web links, this study proposes a novel embedding technique, which is called link2vec, an extension of word2vec. To test the effectiveness and language independency of our link2vec-based model, we applied it to two real-world fake news datasets in different languages (English and Korean). As comparison models, we adopted the conventional text-based model and a hybrid model that combined text and whitelist-based link information proposed by a prior study. Results revealed that in the datasets in two languages, the link2vec-based detection models outperformed all the comparison models with statistical significance. Our research is expected to contribute to suggesting a completely new path for effective fake news detection. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; Fake news detection; Feature selection; Link2vec; Web search result","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109217462"

These include linguistic-based approaches, which often utilise Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL). However, as the latest advancements in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain show, the model’s high performance is no longer enough. The explainability of the system’s decision is equally crucial in real-life scenarios. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to present a novel explainability approach in BERT-based fake news detectors. This approach does not require extensive changes to the system and can be attached as an extension for operating detectors. For this purposes, two Explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) techniques, Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Anchors, will be used and evaluated on fake news data, i.e., short pieces of text forming tweets or headlines. This focus of this paper is on the explainability approach for fake news detectors, as the detectors themselves were part of previous works of the authors. © 2021, The Author(s).","","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120977480"

Fake news and the dissemination of fake stories is nothing new to us; it has existed even before the internet was invented. But now due to social media, any person sitting at any corner of the world can create and spread fake news or rumors within minutes, which has the potential to create serious negative implications for society As a consequence, the identification of false news has arisen as a modern study field that is gaining more and more interest every day. In this article, we'll concentrate on the legitimacy of social network news. With the aid of Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM)-recurrent neural networks, we expect to present a false news identification model. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) are two deep neural networks that have been shown to recognizedifferent dynamic trends in textual results. The Dataset used is Fake news Detection Dataset which is publicly available by kaggle, which contains social media news articles that we have used in training our model. As compared to other deep learningstrategies such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Unidirectional Long Short-Term Memory-Recurrent neural networks, and other Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory models, we find that ourproposed Bi-directional LSTM model outperforms in terms of accuracy and performance. © 2021 IEEE.","Convolutional Neural Networks; Credibility; Deep learning; Fake news; Gated Recurrent Unit; Long Short-Term Memory; Recurrent Neural Networks; Social-media","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119008330"

Many existing works on fake news detection utilized spreading information like propagators profiles and the propagation structure. However, such methods face the difficulty of data collection and cannot detect fake news at the early stage. An alternative approach is to detect fake news solely based on its content. Early content-based methods rely on manually designed linguistic features. Such shallow features are domain-dependent, and cannot easily be generalized to cross-domain data. Recently, many natural language processing tasks resort to deep learning methods to learn word, sentence, and document representations. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based neural network model named SemSeq4FD for early fake news detection based on enhanced text representations. In SemSeq4FD, we model the global pair-wise semantic relations between sentences as a complete graph, and learn the global sentence representations via a graph convolutional network with self-attention mechanism. Considering the importance of local context in conveying the sentence meaning, we employ a 1D convolutional network to learn the local sentence representations. The two representations are combined to form the enhanced sentence representations. Then a LSTM-based network is used to model the sequence of enhanced sentence representations, yielding the final document representation for fake news detection. Experiments conducted on four real-world datasets in English and Chinese, including cross-source and cross-domain datasets, demonstrate that our model can outperform the state-of-the-art methods. © 2020","Enhanced text representation; Fake news detection; Global semantic relationship; Graph neural network; Local sequential order","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092102039"

The Online world contains lots of fake news from various sources and channels by political parties, influential peoples, and bots. People are not good for easily able to distinguish fake news from real one. This will negatively impact people's lives, society, and the world. To maintain stability from the harm done by fake news, we will tackle the topic of fake news detection. we are investigating the effectiveness of machine learning technologies and also introducing a deep learning model for fake news detection with better accuracy. We are using Natural language processing with the above technologies for our purpose. In investigating the effectiveness of machine learning technologies, we had applied various classification algorithms on our data processed by NLP to obtain their accuracy for the problem. Then using new emerging technologies like deep learning, we are proposing solutions with better accuracy. In the machine learning technologies for fake news detection, we have found that AdaBoost classifier, Gradient boosting classifier, and Logistic regression are better in terms of accuracy than other classifiers like decision tree, KNeighbors classifier, Random Forest classifier, and MultinomialNB. But These technologies are more prone to error when a different category of data comes. Deep learning technology used here is the Long short-term memory deep learning model which gave us an accuracy of more than 0.993 and the Bi-directional LSTM model with accuracy near 0.99 taking more time in training than the LSTM model. Through this research, we conclude that machine learning technologies perform worse than deep learning technologies. And proposed LSTM model is better than the Bi-directional LSTM model for fake news detection. © 2021 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Long Short-Term Memory; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123386030"

The ease of access and sharing the data with the revolution in mobile technology has led to the proliferation of fake news. Fake news has the potential to manipulate public opinions and hence, may harm society. Thus, it is necessary to examine the credibility and authenticity of the news articles being shared on social media. Nowadays, the problem of fake news has gained massive attention from research communities and needed an optimal solution with high efficiency and low efficacy. Existing detection methods are based on either news-content or social-context using user-based features as an individual. In this paper, the content of the news article and the existence of echo chambers (community of social media-based users sharing the same opinions) in the social network are taken into account for fake news detection. A tensor representing social context (correlation between user profiles on social media and news articles) is formed by combining the news, user and community information. The news content is fused with the tensor, and coupled matrix-tensor factorization is employed to get a representation of both news content and social context. The proposed method has been tested on a real-world dataset: BuzzFeed. The factors obtained after decomposition have been used as features for news classification. An ensemble machine learning classifier (XGBoost) and a deep neural network model (DeepFakE) are employed for the task of classification. Our proposed model (DeepFakE) outperforms with the existing fake news detection methods by applying deep learning on combined news content and social context-based features as an echo-chamber. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Deep learning; Echo chamber; Fake news; Social media; Tensor factorization","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085129998"

The spread of this type of misinformation is a severe danger to social cohesiveness and well-being since it increases political polarisation and people's distrust of their leaders. Thus, fake news is a phenomenon that is having a significant impact on our social lives, particularly in politics. This paper proposes novel approaches based on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) for the fake news detection system to address this phenomenon. The main aim of this paper is to find the optimal model that obtains high accuracy performance. Therefore, we propose an optimized Convolutional Neural Network model to detect fake news (OPCNN-FAKE). We compare the performance of the OPCNN-FAKE with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and The six regular ML techniques: Decision Tree (DT), logistic Regression (LR), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB) using four fake news benchmark datasets. Grid search and hyperopt optimization techniques have been used to optimize the parameters of ML and DL, respectively. In addition, N-gram and Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) have been used to extract features from the benchmark datasets for regular ML, while Glove word embedding has been used to represent features as a feature matrix for DL models. To evaluate the performance of the OPCNN-FAKE, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-measure were applied to validate the results. The results show that OPCNN-FAKE model has achieved the best performance for each dataset compared with other models. Furthermore, the OPCNN-FAKE has a higher performance of cross-validation results and testing results over the other models, which indicates that the OPCNN-FAKE for fake news detection is significantly better than the other models.  © 2013 IEEE.","convolutional neural network; deep learning; detection; Fake news; machine learning; neural network; OPCNN-FAKE","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115150924"

While evaluating the performance of deep learning-based models, if all the models are giving higher accuracy on a test dataset, it will make it harder to validate the performance of the deep learning models under consideration. So, one will need a complex problem to validate the performance of a deep learning model. LIAR is one such complex labeled benchmark dataset which is publicly available for doing research on fake news detection to model statistical and machine learning approaches to combating fake news. In this work, a novel fake news detection system is implemented using deep neural network models such as CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and the performance of their attention mechanism is evaluated by analyzing their performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score with training, validation, and test datasets of LIAR. © 2021 IGI Global.

It is quite thought-provoking to distinguish fake information on the internet as it is often written to deceive users. Compared with many machine learning techniques, deep learning-based techniques are capable of detecting fake news more accurately. Previous review papers were based on data mining and machine learning techniques, scarcely exploring the deep learning techniques for fake news detection. However, emerging deep learning-based approaches such as Attention, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations for Transformers are absent from previous surveys. This study attempts to investigate advanced and state-of-the-art fake news detection mechanisms pensively. We begin with highlighting the fake news consequences. Then, we proceed with the discussion on the dataset used in previous research and their NLP techniques. A comprehensive overview of deep learning-based techniques has been bestowed to organize representative methods into various categories. The prominent evaluation metrics in fake news detection are also discussed.

Unfortunately, some users use unethical means to grow their links and reputation by spreading fake news in the form of texts, images, and videos. However, the recent information appearing on an online social network is doubtful, and in many cases, it misleads other users in the network. Fake news is spread intentionally to mislead readers to believe false news, which makes it difficult for detection mechanism to detect fake news on the basis of shared content. Therefore, we need to add some new information related to user's profile, such as user's involvement with others for finding a particular decision. The disseminated information and their diffusion process create a big problem for detecting these contents promptly and thus highlighting the need for automatic fake news detection. In this paper, we are going to introduce automatic fake news detection approach in chrome environment on which it can detect fake news on Facebook. Specifically, we use multiple features associated with Facebook account with some news content features to analyze the behavior of the account through deep learning.

Amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, individuals are inflicted with these false and potentially harmful claims and stories, which may harm the vaccination process. Psychological studies reveal that the human ability to detect deception is only slightly better than chance; therefore, there is a growing need for serious consideration for developing automated strategies to combat fake news that traverses these platforms at an alarming rate. This paper systematically reviews the existing fake news detection technologies by exploring various machine learning and deep learning techniques pre- and post-pandemic, which has never been done before to the best of the authors’ knowledge. Design/methodology/approach: The detailed literature review on fake news detection is divided into three major parts. The authors searched papers no later than 2017 on fake news detection approaches on deep learning and machine learning. The papers were initially searched through the Google scholar platform, and they have been scrutinized for quality. The authors kept “Scopus” and “Web of Science” as quality indexing parameters. All research gaps and available databases, data pre-processing, feature extraction techniques and evaluation methods for current fake news detection technologies have been explored, illustrating them using tables, charts and trees. Findings: The paper is dissected into two approaches, namely machine learning and deep learning, to present a better understanding and a clear objective. Next, the authors present a viewpoint on which approach is better and future research trends, issues and challenges for researchers, given the relevance and urgency of a detailed and thorough analysis of existing models. This paper also delves into fake new detection during COVID-19, and it can be inferred that research and modeling are shifting toward the use of ensemble approaches. Originality/value: The study also identifies several novel automated web-based approaches used by researchers to assess the validity of pandemic news that have proven to be successful, although currently reported accuracy has not yet reached consistent levels in the real world. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; COVID-19; Deep learning; Fake news detection; Machine learning; Misinformation; Natural language processing; Social media","Review","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112361887"

The more people depend on online news, magazines, and journals, the more likely it will have more significant consequences of fake news or rumors. In the era of social networking, it has become a significant problem that negatively influences society. The fact is that the internet has become more accessible than ever, and its uses have increased exponentially. From 2005 to 2020, overall web users have increased from 1.1 billion to 3.96 billion [16]. As most individuals' primary sources are microblogging networks, fake news spreads faster than ever. Thus it has become very complicated to detect fake news over the internet. For that purpose, we have used four traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms and long short-term memory (LSTM) methods. The four traditional methods are as follows logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT) classification, k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classification, and naive bayes (NB) classification. To conduct this experiment, we first implemented four traditional machine learning methods. Then we trained our dataset with LSTM and Bi-LSTM (bidirectional long-short term memory) to get the best-optimized result. This paper experimented with four traditional methods and two deep learning models to find the best models for detecting fake news. In our research, we can see that, from four traditional methods, logistic regression performs best and generate 96% accuracy, and the Bi-LSTM model can generate 99% accuracy, which outbreaks all previous scores. © 2022 AIUB Office of Research and Publication.

Therefore, it becomes vital to create a framework for the automatic verification of content shared online. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework using stacked Bi-LSTM with self-attention to detect fake news articles. The proposed model uses contextual embeddings pooled from BERT large model by fine-tuning its last ten layers on the training dataset. The proposed framework's effectiveness is being tested on four different open-source datasets, namely, News Articles Dataset, Kaggle Dataset, Gossipcop Dataset, and Politifact Dataset, through extensive experimentation and evaluation.

Politicians in the political world usually rely on fake news as a powerful mechanism to change public opinion. Fake news spread through the media poses a real threat to the credibility of information, and the detection of fake news has attracted increased attention in recent years. Therefore, it becomes highly necessary to develop a method to identify fake news. This paper proposes a new ensemble voting model for detecting fake news in online text using a hybrid of machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Our ensemble model consists of three algorithms, namely, Convolution Neural Network (CNN) Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Random Forest. We relied on Natural language processing to extract statistical and representative features from the LIAR dataset. We experimented with the extracted features with our ensemble model. Experimental evaluation showed that our model achieves the best performance on the LIAR dataset with an accuracy of 0.410. © 2022 IEEE.","Convolution Neural Network (CNN); Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU); Natural Language processing (NLP); Random Forest; Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132422141"

With the sophistication of techniques for developing these counterfeits, it is becoming increasingly difficult to detect whether public appearances or statements by influential people respond to parameters of reality or, on the contrary, are the result of fictitious representations. These synthetic documents, generated by computerized techniques based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), pose serious threats to privacy, in a new scenario in which the risks derived from identity theft are increasing. This study aims to advance the state of the art through the analysis of academic news and through an exhaustive literature review, seeking answers to the following questions, which we understand to be of general interest, from both an economic and a social perspective and in various areas of research. What are deepfakes? Who produces them and what technology supports them? What opportunities do they present? What risks are associated with them? What methods exist to combat them? And framing the study in terms of information theory: is this a revolution or an evolution of fake news? As we know, fake news influences public opinion and is effective in appealing to emotions and modifying behaviours. We can assume that these new audiovisual texts will be tremendously effective in undermining, even more if possible, the credibility of digital media, as well as accelerating the already evident exhaustion of critical thinking. © 2021.

However, the process of collecting data labels can be complex and costly. A standard procedure is to add labels sequentially by querying an annotator until reaching satisfactory performance. Active learning is a process of selecting unlabeled data records for which the knowledge of the label would bring the highest discriminability of the dataset. In this paper, we provide a comparative study of various active learning strategies for different embeddings of the text on various datasets. We focus on Bayesian active learning methods that are used due to their ability to represent the uncertainty of the classification procedure. We compare three types of uncertainty representation: i) SGLD, ii) Dropout, and iii) deep ensembles. The latter two methods in cold-and warm-start versions. The texts were embedded using Fast Text, LASER, and RoBERTa encoding techniques. The methods are tested on two types of datasets, text categorization (Kaggle News Category and Twitter Sentiment140 dataset) and fake news detection (Kaggle Fake News and Fake News Detection datasets). We show that the conventional dropout Monte Carlo approach provides good results for the majority of the tasks. The ensemble methods provide more accurate representation of uncertainty that allows to keep the pace of learning of a complicated problem for the growing number of requests, outperforming the dropout in the long run. However, for the majority of the datasets the active strategy using Dropout MC and Deep Ensembles achieved almost perfect performance even for a very low number of requests.

To date, many algorithms have been proposed to facilitate the detection of fake news from the hand-crafted feature extraction methods to deep learning approaches. However, these methods may suffer from the following limitations: (1) fail to utilize the multi-modal context information and extract high-order complementary information for each news to enhance the detection of fake news; (2) largely ignore the full hierarchical semantics of textual content to assist in learning a better news representation. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel hierarchical multi-modal contextual attention network (HMCAN) for fake news detection by jointly modeling the multi-modal context information and the hierarchical semantics of text in a unified deep model. Specifically, we employ BERT and ResNet to learn better representations for text and images, respectively. Then, we feed the obtained representations of images and text into a multi-modal contextual attention network to fuse both inter-modality and intra-modality relationships. Finally, we design a hierarchical encoding network to capture the rich hierarchical semantics for fake news detection. Extensive experiments on three public real datasets demonstrate that our proposed HMCAN achieves state-of-the-art performance. © 2021 ACM.","fake news detection; multi-modal learning; social media","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111688171"

When a new domain of fake news appears, it usually contains only a small amount of labeled data. We proposed a novel Domain Adaptation framework for Fake news Detection named DAFD. It adopts a dual strategy based on domain adaptation and adversarial training, aligns the data distribution of the source domain and target domain during the pre-training process, and generates adversarial examples in the embedding space during the fine-tuning process to increase the generalization and robustness of the model, which can effectively detect fake news in a new domain. Extensive experiments on real datasets show that the proposed DAFD achieves the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods for a new domain with a small amount of labeled data. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adversarial training; Domain adaptation; Fake news","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121844074"

However, inaccurate news, or often referred as fake news is a major problem in news dissemination for online medias. Inaccurate news is information that is not true, that is engineered to cover the real information and has no factual basis. Usually, inaccurate news is made in the form of news that has mass appeal and is presented in the guise of genuine and legitimate news nuances to deceive or change the reader's mind or opinion. Identification of inaccurate news from real news can be done with natural language processing (NLP) technologies. In this paper, we proposed bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) for inaccurate news identification.

In this study, we use transfer learning and fine-tuning to adapt BERT for inaccurate news identification.

Deep learning based models show good performance when trained on large amounts of labeled data on events of interest, whereas the performance of models tends to degrade on other events due to domain shift. Therefore, significant challenges are posed for existing detection approaches to detect fake news on emergent events, where large-scale labeled datasets are difficult to obtain. Moreover, adding the knowledge from newly emergent events requires to build a new model from scratch or continue to fine-tune the model, which can be challenging, expensive, and unrealistic for real-world settings. In order to address those challenges, we propose an end-to-end fake news detection framework named MetaFEND, which is able to learn quickly to detect fake news on emergent events with a few verified posts. Specifically, the proposed model integrates meta-learning and neural process methods together to enjoy the benefits of these approaches. In particular, a label embedding module and a hard attention mechanism are proposed to enhance the effectiveness by handling categorical information and trimming irrelevant posts. Extensive experiments are conducted on multimedia datasets collected from Twitter and Weibo. The experimental results show our proposed MetaFEND model can detect fake news on never-seen events effectively and outperform the state-of-the-art methods. © 2021 Owner/Author.","fake news detection; meta-learning; natural language processing","Conference paper","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114172969"

This form of news reporting, especially via social media campaigns has boosted the access and fabrication of bogus reporting, or what is referred to as fake news. Fake news, in the form of clickbait, hoax, satire, propaganda, hyperpartisan, deepfakes, or simply unreliable news has the power of influencing its readers to a dangerous extent, predominantly causing political, socio-economic, or psychological harm. In this chapter, we analyze the meaning of fake news in the world of social media, the various forms it can take, what causes its spread, and what are the rudimentary signs of such fake news. We will walk through a comparative study of the state-of-the-art deep learning models to approach the tasks of identifying phony information, verifying the validity of various claims and facts, catching fake content, and so on. The exposition will especially elucidate the adversarial approaches in deep learning to detect counterfeit content that could come in any form like text, images, videos, or audio. In doing so, we establish the importance of generating plausible and understandable explanations for model predictions with a special emphasis on algorithm fairness. With the fact that deep learning methods rely on comparatively larger datasets of top-notch quality, this chapter will also highlight the availability of relevant datasets in this space, as well as share pointers to curate one if needed. Even with sufficient data, however, detection problems in this domain are especially challenging since spammers and fake content generators are working tirelessly to evolve their strategies in parallel to the advancement in detection mechanisms. We will further shed some light on some recent and upcoming trends from the aspect of fake news contributors, and critically evaluate how our current state-of-the-art deep learning techniques fare against those. In closing, we will leave readers with some thoughts on future directions for the development of better and smarter fake news detectors. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Book chapter","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138673674"

However, rapid spread and instant access to information/news can also enable rumors or fake news to spread very easily and rapidly. In order to monitor and minimize the spread of fake news in the digital community, fake news detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP) has attracted significant attention. In NLP, different text feature extractors and word embeddings are used to process the text data. The aim of this paper is to analyze the performance of a fake news detection model based on neural networks using 3 feature extractors: TD-IDF vectorizer, Glove embeddings, and BERT embeddings. For the evaluation, multiple metrics, namely accuracy, precision, F1, recall, AUC ROC, and AUC PR were computed for each feature extractor. All the transformation techniques were fed to the deep learning model. It was found that BERT embeddings for text transformation delivered the best performance. TD-IDF has been performed far better than Glove and competed the BERT as well at some stages. © 2021, Dr D. Pylarinos.

The existing fake News detection model, namely Factual News Graph (FANG), is a novel social context representation and learning framework for fake news detection. Focusing on representation learning, this inductive model is superior to conventional contextual models for its efficiency, scalability, and robustness. However, we find that the framework does not take inner/inter variants into consideration. Specifically, this method treats each news item as an independent individual and ignores the latent relationship among them, which may inevitably limit the accuracy. In order to improve the discriminative power, we propose a new model called Discriminative-FANG, which enhances the discriminative power of the model on fake news detection. By means of adding a discriminative regularization term, our model finds deep feature centers of every class and minimizes the distances between all the features and their class centers simultaneously. Thus, it leads to better learning inter-class dispersion as well as intra-class compactness. Moreover, experiments are carried out on several popular Fake News Detection datasets, which verify the better performance of our model than other popular baselines by a large margin.  © 2021 IEEE.Allrights reserved","center loss; deep learning; discriminative feature learning; fake news detection; stance detection","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126460229"

However, efforts to study a general framework for exploiting knowledge, for judging the trustworthiness of given news based on their content, have been limited. Indeed, the existing works rarely consider incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs), which could provide rich structured knowledge for better language understanding. In this work, we propose a deep triple network (DTN) that leverages knowledge graphs to facilitate fake news detection with triple-enhanced explanations. In the DTN, background knowledge graphs, such as open knowledge graphs and extracted graphs from news bases, are applied for both low-level and high-level feature extraction to classify the input news article and provide explanations for the classification. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by demonstrating abundant convincing comparative experiments. Obtained results show that DTN outperforms conventional fake news detection methods from different aspects, including the provision of factual evidence supporting the decision of fake news detection. © 2021","Deep learning; Fake news detection; Knowledge graph; Knowledge graph embedding; Multi-channel","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115024582"

However, these extracted features still suffer from many irrelevant and noisy features that restrict severely the performance of the approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel model based on Adversarial Networks and inspirited by the Shared-Private model (ANSP), which aims at reducing common, irrelevant features from the extracted features for information credibility evaluation. Specifically, ANSP involves two tasks: one is to prevent the binary classification of true and false information for capturing common features relying on adversarial networks guided by reinforcement learning. Another extracts credibility features (henceforth, private features) from multiple types of credibility information and compares with the common features through two strategies, i.e., orthogonality constraints and KL-divergence for making the private features more differential. Experiments first on two six-label LIAR and Weibo datasets demonstrate that ANSP achieves state-of-the-art performance, boosting the accuracy by 2.1%, 3.1%, respectively and then on four-label Twitter16 validate the robustness of the model with 1.8% performance improvements. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Adversarial networks; Fake news detection; Information credibility evaluation; Reinforcement learning","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077458112"

Due to the availability of the Internet, a lot of user-generated content is produced across the globe in a single day using various social media platforms. Nowadays, it has become very easy to create fake news and propagate it worldwide within a short period of time. Despite receiving significant attention in the research community, fake news detection did not improve significantly due to insufficient context-specific news data. Most of the researchers have analyzed the fake news problem as a binary classification problem, but many more prediction classes exist. In this research work, experiments have been conducted using a tree-based Ensemble Machine Learning framework (Gradient Boosting) with optimized parameters combining content and context level features for fake news detection. Recently, adaptive boosting methods for classification problems have been derived as gradient descent algorithms. This formulation justifies key elements and parameters in the methods, which are chosen to optimize a single common objective function. Experiments are conducted using a multi-class dataset (FNC) and various machine learning models are used for classification. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ensemble framework compared to existing benchmark results. Using the Gradient Boosting algorithm (an ensemble machine learning framework), we achieved an accuracy of 86% for multi-class classification of fake news having four classes. © 2019 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Fake News; Gradient Boosting; Machine Learning","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079318599"

Developing effective methods to detect them early is of paramount importance. A major challenge of fake news early detection is fully utilizing the limited data observed at the early stage of news propagation and then learning useful patterns from it for identifying fake news. In this article, we propose a novel deep neural network to detect fake news early. It has three novel components: (1) a status-sensitive crowd response feature extractor that extracts both text features and user features from combinations of users' text response and their corresponding user profiles, (2) a position-aware attention mechanism that highlights important user responses at specific ranking positions, and (3) a multi-region mean-pooling mechanism to perform feature aggregation based on multiple window sizes. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can detect fake news with greater than 90% accuracy within 5 minutes after it starts to spread and before it is retweeted 50 times, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art baselines. Most importantly, our approach requires only 10% labeled fake news samples to achieve this effectiveness under PU-Learning settings.  © 2020 ACM.","deep learning; Fake news detection; social media","Review","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088296412"

One promising solution for countering this threat is to leverage deep learning (DL)-based text classification methods for fake-news detection. However, since such methods have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, the integrity and security of DL-based fake news classifiers are under question. Although many works study text classification under the adversarial threat, to the best of our knowledge, we do not find any work in literature that specifically analyzes the performance of DL-based fake-news detectors under adversarial settings. We bridge this gap by evaluating the performance of fake-news detectors under various configurations under black-box settings. In particular, we investigate the robustness of four different DL architectural choices-multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN) and a recently proposed Hybrid CNN-RNN trained on three different state-of-the-art datasets-under different adversarial attacks (Text Bugger, Text Fooler, PWWS, and Deep Word Bug) implemented using the state-of-the-art NLP attack library, Text-Attack. Additionally, we explore how changing the detector complexity, the input sequence length, and the training loss affect the robustness of the learned model. Our experiments suggest that RNNs are robust as compared to other architectures. Further, we show that increasing the input sequence length generally increases the detector’s robustness. Our evaluations provide key insights to robustify fake-news detectors against adversarial attacks. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Via social media platforms, fake news travel at unprecedented speeds, reach global audiences and put users and communities at great risk. Therefore, it is extremely important to detect fake news as early as possible. Recently, deep learning based approaches have shown improved performance in fake news detection. However, the training of such models requires a large amount of labeled data, but manual annotation is time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, due to the dynamic nature of news, annotated samples may become outdated quickly and cannot represent the news articles on newly emerged events. Therefore, how to obtain fresh and high-quality labeled samples is the major challenge in employing deep learning models for fake news detection. In order to tackle this challenge, we propose a reinforced weakly-supervised fake news detection framework, i.e., WeFEND, which can leverage users’ reports as weak supervision to enlarge the amount of training data for fake news detection. The proposed framework consists of three main components: the annotator, the reinforced selector and the fake news detector. The annotator can automatically assign weak labels for unlabeled news based on users’ reports. The reinforced selector using reinforcement learning techniques chooses high-quality samples from the weakly labeled data and filters out those low-quality ones that may degrade the detector’s prediction performance. The fake news detector aims to identify fake news based on the news content. We tested the proposed framework on a large collection of news articles published via WeChat official accounts and associated user reports. Extensive experiments on this dataset show that the proposed WeFEND model achieves the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

Even a human being finds it difficult to decide the authenticity of an article without further fact checking. Hence a Deep Learning model entirely based on NLP is bound to have huge limitations. In order to address this shortcoming, the proposed system additionally includes a live data stage mining which provides secondary features. These features include source domains of the article, author names etc. Since these features mimic the process of fact-checking to an extent, the model is expected to outperform existing models that are solely based on NLP. We seek to compare the results from models with and without secondary mined features. LSTM and FF Neural Networks are explored. Additionally, effectiveness of different word vector representations in relation to this problem are also investigated. © 2020 The Authors.

Social platforms are under constant pressure to come up with efficient methods to solve this problem because users' interaction with fake and unreliable news leads to its spread at an individual level. This spreading of misinformation adversely affects the perception about an important activity, and as such, it needs to be dealt with using a modern approach. In this paper, we collect 1356 news instances from various users via Twitter and media sources such as PolitiFact and create several datasets for the real and the fake news stories. Our study compares multiple state-of-the-art approaches such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memories (LSTMs), ensemble methods, and attention mechanisms.

In an effort to combat the dissemination of fake news, designing machine learning models that can classify text as fake or not has become an active line of research. While new models are continuously being developed, the focus so far has mainly been aimed at improving the accuracy of the models for given datasets. Hence, there is little research done in the direction of explainability of the deep learning (DL) models constructed for the task of fake news detection.In order to add a level of explainability, several aspects have to be taken into consideration. For instance, the pre-processing phase, or the length and complexity of the text play an important role in achieving a successful classification. These aspects need to be considered in conjunction with the model's architecture. All of these issues are addressed and analyzed in this paper. Visualizations are further employed to grasp a better understanding how different models distribute their attention when classifying fake news texts. In addition, statistical data is gathered to deepen the analysis and to provide insights with respect to the model's interpretability. © 2020 IEEE.","Deep learning; Explainability; Fake news","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102496989"

It has caused an alarming proliferation of fake news on social networks. The global nature of social networks has facilitated international blowout of fake news. Fake news has proven to increase political polarization and partisan conflict. Fake news is also found to be more rampant on social media than mainstream media. The evil of fake news is garnering a lot of attention and research effort. In this work, we have tried to handle the spread of fake news via tweets. We have performed fake news classification by employing user characteristics as well as tweet text. Thus, trying to provide a holistic solution for fake news detection. For classifying user characteristics, we have used the XGBoost algorithm which is a collaboration of decision trees utilizing the boosting method. Further to correctly classify the tweet text we used various natural language processing techniques to preprocess the tweets and then applied a sequential neural network and state-of-the-art BERT transformer to classify the tweets. The models have then been evaluated and compared with various baseline models to show that our approach effectively tackles this problem. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Classification; Fake news; Gradient boosting; Text classification; Transfer learning; Transformers; Twitter","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121614679"

Most of the models proposed for fake news detection address the resource rich languages such as English and Spanish but, languages such as Urdu, Persian, Balouchi and many Indian native languages have received very less attention due to unavailability of bench marked corpus. To promote text processing activities on Urdu, which happens to be a resource poor language FIRE 2020 (Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation) has called for UrduFake, a shared task to detect fake news in Urdu language. High speed of news broadcast and the importance of detecting fake news from the real news made us (team MUCS) to propose three different learning models namely, an ensemble of Machine Learning (ML) models, Transfer Learning (TL) model based on ULMFiT and a hybrid model made up of an ensemble of ML approaches, TL approach and Deep Learning (DL).

However, it is now widely recognized that there is an increasing amount of fake news on the Internet. Fake news can be very similar to real news, so it is often difficult for readers to distinguish the truth/veracity of the news they read. Machine learning and deep learning models can help in this regard. In this paper, we compare and analyse the performance of four machine learning models (Logistic regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naïve Bayes) and three deep learning models (Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and BERT) on data sets comprising both true and fake news. We explore different methods for extracting language features from the news and evaluate the performance of the model using accuracy as an evaluation indicator. We identified that the BERT model reached an accuracy of 86.76 and was most effective. © 2021 IEEE","Deep learning; Fake news; Machine learning; Social media","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124005272"

Although platforms like Facebook and Twitter allow for a quicker, wider and less restricted access to information, they also consist of a breeding ground for the dissemination of fake news. Most of the existing literature on fake news detection on social media proposes user-based or content-based approaches. However, recent research revealed that real and fake news also propagate significantly differently on Twitter. Nonetheless, only a few articles so far have explored the use of propagation features in their detection. Additionally, most of them have based their analysis on a narrow tweet retrieval methodology that only considers tweets to be propagating a news piece if they explicitly contain an URL link to an online news article. By basing our analysis on a broader tweet retrieval methodology that also allows tweets without an URL link to be considered as propagating a news piece, we contribute to fill this research gap and further confirm the potential of using propagation features to detect fake news on Twitter. We firstly show that real news are significantly bigger in size, are spread by users with more followers and less followings, and are actively spread on Twitter for a longer period of time than fake news. Secondly, we achieve an 87% accuracy using a Random Forest Classifier solely trained on propagation features. Lastly, we design a Geometric Deep Learning approach to the problem by building a graph neural network that directly learns on the propagation graphs and achieve an accuracy of 73.3%. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Fake news; Propagation; Twitter","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096425511"

Then, an ensemble learning model combining four different models called embedding LSTM, depth LSTM, LIWC CNN, and N-gram CNN is proposed for fake news detection. Besides, to achieve higher accuracy in fake news detection, the optimized weights of the ensemble learning model are determined using the Self-Adaptive Harmony Search (SAHS) algorithm. In the experiments, we verify that the proposed model is superior to the state-of-the-art methods, with the highest accuracy of 99.4%. Furthermore, we also investigate the cross-domain intractability issue and achieve the highest accuracy of 72.3%.

In the meantime, fake news now spreads at a faster pace and affects a larger population than ever before. Compared with traditional text news, the news posted on microblog often has attached images in the context. So how to correctly and autonomously detect fakes news in a multi-modal manner becomes a prominent challenge to be addressed. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end model, named BERT-based domain adaptation neural network for multi-modal fake news detection (BDANN). BDANN comprises three main modules: a multi-modal feature extractor, a domain classifier and a fake news detector. Specifically, the multi-modal feature extractor employs the pretrained BERT model to extract text features and the pretrained VGG-19 model to extract image features. The extracted features are then concatenated and fed to the detector to distinguish fake news. The role of the domain classifier is mainly to map the multi-modal features of different events to the same feature space. To assess the performance of BDANN, we conduct extensive experiments on two multimedia datasets: Twitter and Weibo. The experimental results show that BDANN outperforms the state-of-the-art models. Moreover, we further discuss the existence of noisy images in the Weibo dataset that may affect the results. © 2020 IEEE.","Data mining; Deep learning; Fake news detection; Multimedia; Natural language processing","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093848346"

However, this revolution in the way that information is released has provided the growth of something that always walked side by side with the real news: we are talking about fake news. After the 2016 U.S. presidential election this term became more popular and dangerous because of its negative effect on society. In this context, recent contributions has appeared addressing several related topics, such as spreading behavior, methods for spreading contention, and fake news detection algorithms. Despite of the growth of this type of research, it is difficult for a researcher to identify the current state-of-the-art literature about fake news detection. To overcome this obstacle, this paper presents a systematic review of the literature that brings an overview of this research area and analyzes the the high-quality studies about fake news detection. Through this systematic literature review, more than 6,000 articles were found according to our search protocol. Then, we put these studies through stages of screening to ensure that they were quality assessed. Were elected 32 high-quality studies according to our PRISMA flow diagram defined in this paper. These studies were then categorized by their contribution type and algorithm.

This is due to the impact of fake news on the internet especially on social media. Numerous of the models proposed in the previous studies are based on supervised learning. Therefore, these models are unable to deal with the huge amount of unlabeled data about fake news. Few studies focused on early detection. In this study, we built a semi-supervised learning model to detect fake news on social media at an early stage. By using a semi-supervised learning, we make our model able to deal with the huge amount of unlabeled data on social media. We first built a model to extract users' opinion expressed in comments, then we used CredRank Algorithm to evaluate users' credibility and built a small network of users involved in the spread of a given news. The outputs of these three steps serve as inputs of our news classifier SSLNews. SSLNews is composed of three networks: A shared CNN, an unsupervised CNN and a supervised CNN. We used real world datasets to evaluate our model, Politifact and Gossipcop. When using 25% of labeled data, SSLNews reaches an accuracy of 72.25% on Politifact and 70.35% on Gossipcop. When using data produced in the first 10 minutes of the beginning of the spread of the news, SSLNews reaches an accuracy of 71.10% on Politifact and 68.07% on Gossipcop. © 2020 IEEE.","credibility assessment; Fake news detection; semi-supervised learning","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101633276"

The increased connectivity, referred to as hyper-connectivity, has led to the development of smart cities. People in these smart cities can access numerous online contents and are always connected. These developments, however, also lead to a lack of standardization and consistency in the propagation of information throughout communities due to the consumption of information through social media channels. Information cannot often be verified, which can confuse the users. The increasing influence of social media has thus led to the emergence and increasing prevalence of fake news. In this study, we propose a methodology to classify and identify fake news emanating from social channels. We collected content from Twitter to detect fake news and statistically verified that the temporal propagation pattern of quote retweets is effective for the classification of fake news. To verify this, we trained the temporal propagation pattern to a two-phases deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory. The fake news classifier demonstrates the ability for its early detection. Moreover, it was verified that the temporal propagation pattern was the most influential feature compared to other feature groups discussed in this paper. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

In order to achieve timely detection of fake news in social media, a novel framework of two-path deep semisupervised learning (SSL) is proposed where one path is for supervised learning and the other is for unsupervised learning. The supervised learning path learns on the limited amount of labeled data, while the unsupervised learning path is able to learn on a huge amount of unlabeled data. Furthermore, these two paths implemented with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are jointly optimized to complete SSL. In addition, we build a shared CNN to extract the low-level features on both labeled data and unlabeled data to feed them into these two paths. To verify this framework, we implement a Word CNN-based SSL model and test it on two data sets: LIAR and PHEME.

With ample availability of news content online, these news articles has by-products in information generation in both ways-real and fake news. Considering the context and volume of information shared online, it is challenging to establish authenticity of news. This leads to the immense growth of fake news on various websites, which can lead to serious concerns in society, fading away the correct news content to reach the users creating misconceptions and deceived views of the readers.

Data relevance in both decision making and decision taking has exponentially increased. Content examination, social network analysis, information propagation (including epidemic and statistical modeling analysis), or sentiment analysis techniques are currently used to classify and curate information. Nonetheless, mis- and dis-information are among the major current cybersecurity challenges, as it is hindering the very health of our democratic systems. As a result, there is an urge to devise and implement technical solutions to detect and deter the propagation of unreliable information. In this work, we consider a specific case in the taxonomy of the complex scenarios of mis- and dis-information phenomena, the so-called fake news. In short, we used labeled data set containing fake news, which are going to be detected by means of traditional natural language processing techniques and advanced deep learning approaches. Our intention relies on comparing the accuracy of simple methods (namely, traditional natural language processing) with respect to modern and complex techniques in the deep learning family.

In the era of social networks, the quick rotation of news makes it challenging to evaluate its reliability promptly. Therefore, automated fake news detection tools have become a crucial requirement. To address the aforementioned issue, a hybrid Neural Network architecture, that combines the capabilities of CNN and LSTM, is used with two different dimensionality reduction approaches, Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Chi-Square. This work proposed to employ the dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors before passing them to the classifier. To develop the reasoning, this work acquired a dataset from the Fake News Challenges (FNC) website which has four types of stances: agree, disagree, discuss, and unrelated. The nonlinear features are fed to PCA and chi-square which provides more contextual features for fake news detection. The motivation of this research is to determine the relative stance of a news article towards its headline. The proposed model improves results by 4% and 20% in terms of Accuracy and F1-score.

This has abated trust in the media, leaving readers in a state of perplexity. There exists an enormous assemblage of research on the theme of Artificial Intelligence (AI) strategies for fake news detection. In the past, much of the focus has been given on classifying online reviews and freely accessible online social networking-based posts. In this work, we propose a deep convolutional neural network (FNDNet) for fake news detection. Instead of relying on hand-crafted features, our model (FNDNet) is designed to automatically learn the discriminatory features for fake news classification through multiple hidden layers built in the deep neural network. We create a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract several features at each layer. We compare the performance of the proposed approach with several baseline models. Benchmarked datasets were used to train and test the model, and the proposed model achieved state-of-the-art results with an accuracy of 98.36% on the test data. Various performance evaluation parameters such as Wilcoxon, false positive, true negative, precision, recall, F1, and accuracy, etc. were used to validate the results. These results demonstrate significant improvements in the area of fake news detection as compared to existing state-of-the-art results and affirm the potential of our approach for classifying fake news on social media. This research will assist researchers in broadening the understanding of the applicability of CNN-based deep models for fake news detection. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Deep learning; Fake news; Machine learning; Neural network; Social media","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078707421"

Moreover, we explore the idea that opinion-based news articles cannot be classified as real or fake due to their subjective nature and often sensationalised language, and propose a novel two-step classification pipeline to remove such articles from both model training and the final deployed inference system.

Over the past years, many fake news detection approaches have been introduced, and most of the existing methods rely on either news content or the social context of the news dissemination process on social media platforms. In this work, we propose a generic model that is able to take into account both the news content and the social context for the identification of fake news. Specifically, we explore different aspects of the news content by using both shallow and deep representations. The shallow representations are produced with word2vec and doc2vec models while the deep representations are generated via transformer-based models. These representations are able to jointly or separately address four individual tasks, namely bias detection, clickbait detection, sentiment analysis, and toxicity detection. In addition, we make use of graph convolutional neural networks and mean-field layers in order to exploit the underlying structural information of the news articles. That way, we are able to take into account the inherent correlation between the articles by leveraging their social context information. Experiments on widely-used benchmark datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.  © 2013 IEEE.","bias detection; clickbait detection; deep learning; Fake news detection; Markov random field; question answering; representation learning; sentiment analysis; toxicity detection","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115189785"

The goal of this task is to classify the veracity labels of a statement expressed by a politician into fine-grained classes (degrees of truth). Previous deep learning approaches have significantly improved the performance of Political Fake Statement Detection by modeling statement with the speaker's credit history. However, the credit history may not be available in reality and most approaches did not consider about the evidence that supporting or denying claims when detecting fake news. In addition, state-of-the-art models may struggle to detect fine-grained labels because the statement of the speaker expresses factual and incorrect instances at the same time. In this paper, we approach the Political Fake Statement Detection problem by proposing two multi-stage feature-assisted neural models that consider claims and justifications as an input in a stance detection manner. We explore five-stage and three-stage classification strategies to better discern between the fine-grained labels of fake news. The proposed model in each stage is built on the powerful combination between dual GRU layers and lexical features which we further optimise by using Gaussian Noise. An extensive experimental work on a real-world benchmark LIARPLUS (an extended version of LIAR) dataset shows that three-stage model achieves state-of-the-art Accuracy (46.13%) and F1score (45.13%) without using metadata and the credit history of the speaker. We also experimentally show that modeling the credit history in conjunction with statement and justification gives more than 6% improvement (e.g. 52.23% and 52.26% respectively).  © 2020 IEEE.","deep learning; Fake news detection; lexical features; multistage classification; political fake statement detection","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098994886"

Techniques of fake news stories detection ingenious, varied, and exciting. This study aims to apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text analytics and train deep learning models for detecting fake news based on news title or news content. Solution proposed in this study aims to be applied in real-world social media and eliminate the bad experience for user to receive misleading stories that come from non-reputable source. For NLP techniques, text preprocessing such as regular expression, tokenization, lemmatization and stop words removal are used before vectorizing them into N-gram vectors or sequence vectors using terms frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) or one-hot encoding respectively. Then, TensorFlow is chosen as the framework to be used with built in Keras deep learning libraries that is having a large community and number of commits on Tensorflow GitHub repository that can be enough to build deep learning neural network models. Results from the models are showing that models trained with news content can achieve better performance with computation time being sacrificed while models trained with news title require less computation time to achieve good performance. Also, overall performance of models fed with N-gram vectors are slightly better than models fed with sequence vectors. © 2020 IEEE.","deep learning; Fake news; Keras; natural language processing; neural network; TensorFlow","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086628785"

Their impact affect both personal and political decisions where the latter is more important. Due to the variety of news sources and the complexity of validations, machine learning approaches are used to automatically analyze the news. The aim of this research is to detect fake news using deep learning techniques. The method is based on a semi-supervised learning framework targeting both labeled and unlabeled data using convolutional neural network. In this method, first, various features of text and image data are extracted using CNN. Then, linear discrimination analysis (LDA) is used to predict the classes of unclassified data. Also, the fitness function is modified in a way to increase the effect of estimated class in each step. Results show that the proposed method outperforms other methods in terms of recall, specificity, and sensitivity with a precision value of 95.5%. © 2020 IEEE.","Convolution neural network; Deep learning; Fake news; Linear discrimination analysis","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098333460"

The very network that allows us to know what is happening globally is the perfect breeding ground for malicious and fake news. Combating this fake news is important because the world's view is shaped by information. People not only make important decisions based on information but also form their own opinions. If this information is false it can have devastating consequences. Verifying each news one by one by a human being is completely unfeasible. This paper attempts to expedite the process of identification of fake news by proposing a system that can reliably classify fake news. Machine Learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Passive Aggressive Classifier and Deep Neural Networks have being used on eight different datasets acquired from various sources.

At the same time, all of us are aware that with the increase of different social media platforms, many organizations try to grab people's attention by creating fake news about celebrities, politicians (or) politics, branded products, and others. There are three ways to generate fake news: tampering with an image using advanced morphing tools; this is generally a popular technique while posting phony information about the celebrities (or) cybercrimes related to women. The second one deals with the reposting of the old happenings with new fake content injected into it. For example, in generally few social media platforms either to increase their TRP ratings or to expand their subscribers, they create old news that happened somewhere years ago as latest one with new fake content like by changing the date, time, locations, and other important information and tries to make them viral across the globe. The third one deals with the image/video real happened at an event or place, but media try to change the content with a false claim instead of the original one that occurred. A few decades back, researchers started working on fake news detection topics with the help of textual data. In the recent era, few researchers worked on images and text data using traditional and ensemble deep and machine learning algorithms, but they either suffer from overfitting problems due to insufficient data or unable to extract the complex semantic relations between documents. The proposed system designs a transfer learning environment where Neural Style Transfer Learning takes care of the size and quality of the datasets. It also enhances the auto-encoders by customizing the hidden layers to handle complex problems in the real world. © 2021.

This fact necessitates a focus on fake news detection. Pictures could be viewed as fake news indicators and hence could be used to identify fake news effectively. However, fake news pictures detection is more challenging since fake news picture identification is more difficult than the fake picture recognition. This paper proposes a multi-vision fusion neural network (MVFNN) which consists of four main components: the visual modal module, the visual feature fusion module, the physical feature module and the ensemble module. The visual modal module is responsible for extracting image features from images pixel domain, frequency domain, and tamper detection. It cooperates with the visual features fusion module to detect fake news images from multi-vision fusion. And the ensemble module combines visual features and physical features to detect the fake news pictures.

Today, fake news can be easily created and distributed across many social media platforms and has a widespread impact on the real world. It is critical to develop efficient algorithms and tools for early detection of how false information is disseminated on social media platforms and why it is successful in deceiving users. Most research methods today are based on machine learning, deep learning, feature engineering, graph mining, image and video analysis and newly developed datasets and web services for detecting deceptive content. Therefore, a strong need emerges to find a suitable method that can easily detect false information. A hybrid approach has suggested using the CNN model and RNN-LSTM model to detect false information from this study. First, NLTK toolkit has used to remove stop words, punctuations and special characters from the text. Then the same toolkit applies to tokenize the text and preprocesses the text. From there on, GloVe word embeddings have added to the preprocessed text. Higher-level features of the input text extract from the CNN model using convolutional layers and max-pooling layers. Long-term dependencies between word sequences capture from RNN-LSTM model. The suggested model also applies dropout technology with Dense layers to enhance the efficiency of the hybrid model. Results of the suggested hybrid model have shown that the suggested CNN, RNN-LSTM based Hybrid approach achieves the highest accuracy of 92% by surpassing most of the classical models today with Adam optimizer and Binary Cross-Entropy loss function. © 2020 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Fake News Detection; Hybrid Approach; Natural Language Processing","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100490946"

Although people get much of their information online, some of the Internet news is questionable and even deceptively presented. It is harder to distinguish fake news from the real news as it is sent about in order to trick readers into believing fabricated information, making it increasingly difficult for detection algorithms to identify fake news based on the material that is shared. As a result, an urgent demand for machine learning (ML), deep learning, and artificial intelligence models that can recognize fake news arises. The linguistic characteristics of the news provide a simple method for detecting false news, which the reader does not need to have any additional knowledge to make use of. We discovered that NLP techniques and text-based word vector representation may successfully predict fabricated news using a machine learning approach. In this paper, on datasets containing false and genuine news, we assessed the performance of six machine learning models. We evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Fake news; Linear regression; LR; Machine learning; NLP; SVM","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121860663"

The model consists of a Convolutional Neural Network that can assess whether a given sentence is humorous or not and whether the sentence has a western or Chinese type of humor. The model has been trained and tested over the created dataset composed of 463314 English sentences and 111614 Chinese sentences. The initial model setting reached an accuracy of 64,48%. The analysis of the obtained results showed the importance of three main contributors to the model accuracy, namely, the dataset variety, dimension and model’s hyperparameters. Finally, these contributors were optimized by various tests, resulting in the final model obtaining an accuracy of 96,73%.

As the volume of data from the social world is exploding, social media data analysis has become an emerging area in many different disciplines. During crisis events, users may post informative tweets about affected individuals, utility damage or cautions on social media platforms. If such tweets are efficiently and effectively processed and analyzed, city organizations may gain a better situational awareness of the affected citizens and provide better response actions. Advances in deep neural networks have significantly improved the performance in many social media analyzing tasks, e.g., sentiment analysis, fake news detection, crisis data classification, etc. However, deep learning models require a large amount of labeled data for model training, which is impractical to collect, especially at the early stage of a crisis event. To address this limitation, we proposed a BERT-based Adversarial Domain Adaptation model (BERT-ADA) for crisis tweet classification. Our experiments with three real-world crisis datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model over several baselines. © 2020 IEEE.","Adversarial domain adaptation; BERT; Crisis response; Natural language processing; Smart city","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099441877"

The proposed solutions achieved first place in a recent international competition on fake news. For fake news detection, we present two models. The winning model in the competition combines similarity between the embedding of each article's title and the embedding of the top five corresponding google search results. The new model relies on advances in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) end to end deep learning models to identify stylistic differences between legitimate and fake news articles. This second model was developed after the competition and outperforms the winning approach. For news domain detection, the winning model is a hybrid approach composed of named entity features concatenated with semantic embeddings derived from end to end models. For twitter bot detection, we propose to use the following features: duration between account creation and tweet date, presence of a tweet's link, presence of user's location, other tweet's features, and the tweets' metadata.

It solely uses text processing and is insensitive to history and credibility of the author or the source. In this paper, authors have discussed and experimented using word embedding (GloVe) for text pre-processing in order to construct a vector space of words and establish a lingual relationship. The proposed model which is the blend of convolutional neural network and recurrent neural networks architecture has achieved benchmark results in fake news prediction, with the utility of word embeddings complementing the model altogether. Further, to ensure the quality of prediction, various model parameters have been tuned and recorded for the best results possible. Among other variations, addition of dropout layer reduces overfitting in the model, hence generating significantly higher accuracy values.

Supervised machine learning based techniques are being extensively used in the detection of fake news in Social Media. However, the performance of such models degrades in the case of cross-domain data scenarios. In this study, we empirically show that the performance of a model depends on the domain-specific and agnostic case. To conduct this study, we extracted the tweets based on the Afghanistan crisis and developed a dataset which we call 'FakeBan'. The country has witnessed the sudden spread of misinformation where several actors are misusing it as ammunition, leading to far-flung troubling implications. We chose to study the most recent Afghanistan and experimented with three completely different domains widely involved in fake news: national crisis, healthcare, and politics. Several advanced datasets are already available in the domain of healthcare and politics. However, it takes a long time to build a labeled dataset based on a recent national crisis. We propose an adaptive fake news detection technique capable of selecting the model based on the domain (single or cross) and thus address the challenging issues arising from the voluminous and highly varied information available on social media. The results of our study affirm that in the case of domain-specific data, machine learning classifiers have performed well using a set of selected features out of twenty-one extracted features. In contrast, deep learning models, particularly the BERT model, have outperformed traditional machine learning classifiers in domain agnostic cases. © 2021 IEEE.","BERT; cross-domain; Fake news; machine-learning","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133943501"

The Fake News Stance Prediction is the process of automatically classifying the stance of a news article towards a target into one of the following classes: Agree, Disagree, Discuss, Unrelated. The stance prediction task's input is the news articles containing a pair: a headline as the target and a body as a claim. This paper proposes a deep learning architecture using Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory and Autoencoder for stance prediction.

This study focused on classifying fake news on social media with textual content (text classification). In this classification, four traditional methods were applied to extract features from texts (term frequency-inverse document frequency, count vector, character level vector, and N-Gram level vector), employing 10 different machine learning and deep learning classifiers to categorize the fake news dataset.

A critical challenge in this scenario is that there are large volumes of data available online. However, obtaining samples with annotations (i.e. ground-truth labels) is difficult and a known limiting factor for many data analytic tasks including the current problem of news veracity detection. In this paper, we propose a human-machine collaborative learning system to evaluate the veracity of a news content, with a limited amount of annotated data samples. In a semi-supervised scenario, an initial classifier is learnt on a small, limited amount of the annotated data followed by an interactive approach to gradually update the model by shortlisting only relevant samples from the large pool of unlabeled data that are most likely to improve the classifier performance. Our prioritized active learning solution achieves faster convergence in terms of the classification performance, while requiring about 1-2 orders of magnitude fewer annotated samples compared to fully supervised solutions to attain a reasonably acceptable accuracy of nearly 80%. Unlike traditional deep learning architecture, the proposed active learning based deep model designed with a smaller number of more localized filters per layer can efficiently learn from small relevant sample batches that can effectively improve performance in the weakly-supervised learning environment and thus is more suitable for several practical applications. An effective dynamic domain adaptive feature weighting scheme can adjust the relative importance of feature dimensions iteratively. Insightful initial feedback gathered from two independent learning modules (a NLP shallow feature based classifier and a deep classifier), modeled to capture complementary information about data characteristics are finally fused together to achieve an impressive 25% average gain in the detection performance. © 2017 IEEE.","Active Learning; Decision Fusion; Deep Classification; Fake News Detection; Rumor","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047809284"

Our model consists of four layers: word embedding layer, context generation layer, matching layer and inference layer. In word embedding layer, the words in proposition are embedded into word vector. In context generation layer, the word vectors enter into LSTM layer and generate context vector. In matching layer, attention vector is generated from the contextual embedding vector in the previous layer computing the weighted sum. Then, the hidden state vector from LSTM layers and attention vector are compared through matching operation generating the sentences which has the same meaning but different forms. In inference layer, our model calculates the similarity between the generated sentences and the sentences in articles, and classifies the answer, true or false.

The rapid growth and outreach of the social media and the Web have led to the dissemination of questionable and untrusted content among a wider audience, which has negatively influenced their lives and judgment. Many research studies have been conducted to tackle the detection and spreading of fake news, which is misinformation that looks genuine. While the first step of such tasks would be to classify claims associated based on their credibility, the next steps would involve identifying hidden patterns in style, syntax, and content of such news claims. We propose a generalized method based on Deep Neural Networks to detect if a given claim is fake or genuine. We have used a modular approach by combining techniques from information retrieval, natural language processing, and deep learning. Our classifier comprises two main submodules. The first submodule uses the claim to retrieve relevant articles from the knowledge base which can then be used to verify the truth of the claim. It also uses word-level features for prediction. The second submodule uses a deep neural network to learn the underlying style of fake content. Our experiments conducted on benchmark datasets show that for the given classification task we can obtain up to 82.4% accuracy by using a combination of two models; the first model was up to 72% accurate while the second model was around 81% accurate. Our detection model has the potential to automatically detect and prevent the spread of fake news, thus, limiting the caustic influence of technology in the human lives.

One such problem relates to estimating the veracity of a news story, which is a complex and deep problem. The very recently released Fake News Challenge Stage 1 (FNC-1) dataset introduced the benchmark FNC stage-1: stance detection task. This task could be an effective first step towards building a robust fact checking system. In this paper, we correlate this stance detection problem with Textual Entailment (TE).

The fake news can take advantage of multimedia content to mislead readers and get dissemination, which can cause negative effects or even manipulate the public events. One of the unique challenges for fake news detection on social media is how to identify fake news on newly emerged events. Unfortunately, most of the existing approaches can hardly handle this challenge, since they tend to learn event-specific features that can not be transferred to unseen events. In order to address this issue, we propose an end-to-end framework named Event Adversarial Neural Network (EANN), which can derive event-invariant features and thus benefit the detection of fake news on newly arrived events. It consists of three main components: the multi-modal feature extractor, the fake news detector, and the event discriminator. The multi-modal feature extractor is responsible for extracting the textual and visual features from posts. It cooperates with the fake news detector to learn the discriminable representation for the detection of fake news. The role of event discriminator is to remove the event-specific features and keep shared features among events. Extensive experiments are conducted on multimedia datasets collected from Weibo and Twitter. The experimental results show our proposed EANN model can outperform the state-of-the-art methods, and learn transferable feature representations. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Adversarial neural networks; Deep learning; Fake news detection","Conference paper","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051552480"

We employ a deep learning based automated detector through a three level hierarchical attention network (3HAN) for fast, accurate detection of fake news. 3HAN has three levels, one each for words, sentences, and the headline, and constructs a news vector: an effective representation of an input news article, by processing an article in an hierarchical bottom-up manner. The headline is known to be a distinguishing feature of fake news, and furthermore, relatively few words and sentences in an article are more important than the rest. 3HAN gives a differential importance to parts of an article, on account of its three layers of attention. By experiments on a large real-world data set, we observe the effectiveness of 3HAN with an accuracy of 96.77%. Unlike some other deep learning models, 3HAN provides an understandable output through the attention weights given to different parts of an article, which can be visualized through a heatmap to enable further manual fact checking. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Attention mechanism; Deep learning; Fake news; Text classification; Text representation","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85035092969"

While the full details of what transpired during the election are still not known, it appears that multiple groups used social media to spread false information packaged in fabricated news articles that were presented as truthful. Some have argued that this campaign had a material impact on the election. Moreover, the 2016 U.S. presidential election is far from the only campaign where fake news had an apparent role. In this paper, work on a counter-fake-news research effort is presented. In the long term, this project is focused on building an indications and warnings systems for potentially deceptive false content. As part of this project, a dataset of manually classified legitimate and deceptive news articles was curated. The key criteria for classifying legitimate and deceptive articles, identified by the manual classification project, are identified and discussed. The identified criteria can be embodied in a natural language processing system to perform illegitimate content detection. The criteria include the document's source and origin, title, political perspective, and several key content characteristics. This paper presents and evaluates the efficacy of each of these characteristics and their suitability for legitimate versus illegitimate classification. The paper concludes by discussing the use of these characteristics as input to a customized naïve Bayesian probability classifier, the results of the use of this classifier and future work on its development. © 2019 SPIE.","Deep learning; Fake news detection; Naive Bayesian classifier; Qualitative analysis","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070105750"

Fake news that we are interested in is one of many kinds of deception in social media, but it's more important one as it is created with dishonest intention to mislead people. We are concerned about this issue because we have noticed that this phenomenon has recently caused through the means of social communication to change the course of society and peoples and also their views, for example, during revolutions in some Arab countries have emerged some false news that led to the absence of truth and stirs up public opinion and also fake of news is one of the factors Trump successes in the presidential election. So we decided to face and reduce this phenomenon, which is still the main factor to choose most of our decisions. Techniques of fake news detection varied, ingenious, and often exciting. In this paper our objective is to build a classifier that can predict whether a piece of news is fake or not based only its content, thereby approaching the problem from a purely deep learning perspective by RNN technique models (vanilla, GRU) and LSTMs. We will show the difference and analysis of results by applying them to the dataset that we used called LAIR. We found that the results are close, but the GRU is the best of our results that reached (0.217) followed by LSTM (0.2166) and finally comes vanilla (0.215). Due to these results, we will seek to increase accuracy by applying a hybrid model between the GRU and CNN techniques on the same data set. © 2018 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks); Deception detection; Deep Learning; GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit); LSTM (long short-term memories); RNN (Recurrent Neural Network); Vanilla","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063161783"

People can access internet services and applications from anywhere in the world at any time. There is no doubt that these technological advances have made our lives easier and saved our time and efforts. On the other side, we should admit that there is a misuse of internet and its applications including online platforms. As an example, online platforms have been involved in spreading fake news all over the world to serve certain purposes (political, economic, or social media). Detecting fake news is considered one of the hard challenges in term of the existing content-based analysis of traditional methods. Recently, the performance of neural network models have outperformed traditional machine learning methods due to the outstanding ability of feature extraction. Still, there is a lack of research work on detecting fake news in news and time critical events. Therefore, in this paper, we have investigated the automatic identification of fake news over online communication platforms.

Because fake news can be socially problematic, a model that automatically detects such fake news is required. In this paper, we focus on data-driven automatic fake news detection methods. We first apply the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers model (BERT) model to detect fake news by analyzing the relationship between the headline and the body text of news. To further improve performance, additional news data are gathered and used to pre-train this model.

While the correlations among news articles have been shown to be effective cues for online news analysis, existing deep-learning-based methods often ignore this information and only consider each news article individually. To overcome this limitation, we develop a graph-theoretic method that inherits the power of deep learning while at the same time utilizing the correlations among the articles. We formulate fake news detection as an inference problem in a Markov random field (MRF) which can be solved by the iterative mean-field algorithm. We then unfold the mean-field algorithm into hidden layers that are composed of common neural network operations. By integrating these hidden layers on top of a deep network, which produces the MRF potentials, we obtain our deep MRF model for fake news detection. Experimental results on well-known datasets show that the proposed model improves upon various state-of-the-art models. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics","","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080465121"

It is usually created by manipulating images, text, audio, and videos. This indicates that there is a need of multimodal system for fake news detection. Though, there are multimodal fake news detection systems but they tend to solve the problem of fake news by considering an additional sub-task like event discriminator and finding correlations across the modalities. The results of fake news detection are heavily dependent on the subtask and in absence of subtask training, the performance of fake news detection degrade by 10% on an average. To solve this issue, we introduce SpotFake-a multi-modal framework for fake news detection. Our proposed solution detects fake news without taking into account any other subtasks.

Fake news and rumours represent the most popular forms of false and unverified information, respectively, and should be detected as soon as possible for avoiding their dramatic effects. The interest in effective detection techniques has been therefore growing very fast in the last years. In this paper we survey the different approaches to automatic detection of fake news and rumours proposed in the recent literature. In particular, we focus on five main aspects. First, we report and discuss the various definitions of fake news and rumours that have been considered in the literature. Second, we highlight how the collection of relevant data for performing fake news and rumours detection is problematic and we present the various approaches, which have been adopted to gather these data, as well as the publicly available datasets. Third, we describe the features that have been considered in fake news and rumour detection approaches. Fourth, we provide a comprehensive analysis on the various techniques used to perform rumour and fake news detection.

As a result, many researchers have been working on identifying fake news. Most of the fake news detection systems utilize the linguistic feature of the news. However, they have difficulty in sensing highly ambiguous fake news which can be detected only after identifying meaning and latest related information. In this paper, to resolve this problem, we shall present a new Korean fake news detection system using fact DB which is built and updated by human's direct judgement after collecting obvious facts. Our system receives a proposition, and search the semantically related articles from Fact DB in order to verify whether the given proposition is true or not by comparing the proposition with the related articles in fact DB. To achieve this, we utilize a deep learning model, Bidirectional Multi-Perspective Matching for Natural Language Sentence(BiMPM), which has demonstrated a good performance for the sentence matching task. However, BiMPM has some limitations in that the longer the length of the input sentence is, the lower its performance is, and it has difficulty in making an accurate judgement when an unlearned word or relation between words appear. In order to overcome the limitations, we shall propose a new matching technique which exploits article abstraction as well as entity matching set in addition to BiMPM. In our experiment, we shall show that our system improves the whole performance for fake news detection. © 2019 IEEE.","BiLSTM model; Deep learning; Fake news detection; Natural Language Processing; Sentence matching","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074241092"

Conventional methods for cascade prediction heavily depend on the hypothesis of diffusion models and hand-crafted features. Owing to the significant recent successes of deep learning in multiple domains, attempts have been made to predict cascades by developing neural networks based approaches. However, the existing models are not capable of capturing both the underlying structure of a cascade graph and the node sequence in the diffusion process which, in turn, results in unsatisfactory prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a deep multi-task learning framework with a novel design of shared-representation layer to aid in explicitly understanding and predicting the cascades. As it turns out, the learned latent representation from the shared-representation layer can encode the structure and the node sequence of the cascade very well. Our experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the prediction accuracy and reduce the computational cost compared to state-of-the-art baselines. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Cascade graph embedding; Diffusion process embedding; Information cascades; Multi-task learning; Shared-Gate","Conference paper","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073788082"

The rapid growth and outreach of the social media and the Web have led to the dissemination of questionable and untrusted content among a wider audience, which has negatively influenced their lives and judgment. Different election campaigns around the world highlighted how”fake news” - misinformation that looks genuine - can be targeted towards specific communities to manipulate and confuse them. Ever since, automatic fake news detection has gained widespread attention from the scientific community. As a result, many re-search studies have been conducted to tackle the detection and spreading of fake news. While the first step of such tasks would be to classify claims associated based on their credibility, the next steps would involve identifying hidden patterns in style, syntax, and content of such news claims. We provide a comprehensive overview of what has already been done in this domain and other similar fields, and then propose a generalized method based on Deep Neural Networks to identify if a given claim is fake or genuine. By using different features like the authenticity of the source, perceived cognitive authority, style, and content-based factors, and natural language features, it is possible to predict fake news accurately. We have used a modular approach by combining techniques from information retrieval, natural language processing, and deep learning. Our classifier comprises two main sub-modules. The first sub-module uses the claim to retrieve relevant articles from the know-ledge base which can then be used to verify the truth of the claim. It also uses word-level features for prediction. The second sub-module uses a deep neural network to learn the underlying style of fake content. Our experiments conducted on bench-mark datasets show that for the given classification task we can obtain up to 82.4% accuracy by using a combination of two models; the first model was up to 72% accurate while the second model was around 81% accurate. Our detection model has the potential to automatically detect and prevent the spread of fake news, thus, limiting the caustic influence of technology in the human lives. © 2019 IEEE Computer Society.

It means that early fake news detection may be insufficient and we need another complementary approach to mitigate the spread of misinformation. In this paper, we introduce a novel application of text generation for combating fake news. In particular, we (1) leverage online users named fact-checkers, who cite fact-checking sites as credible evidences to fact-check information in public discourse; (2) analyze linguistic characteristics of fact-checking tweets; and (3) propose and build a deep learning framework to generate responses with fact-checking intention to increase the fact-checkers' engagement in fact-checking activities. Our analysis reveals that the fact-checkers tend to refute misinformation and use formal language (e.g. few swear words and Internet slangs). Our framework successfully generates relevant responses, and outperforms competing models by achieving up to 30% improvements. Our qualitative study also confirms that the superiority of our generated responses compared with responses generated from the existing models. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","","Conference paper","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074216453"

Fake news is typically generated for commercial and political interests to mislead and attract readers. The spread of fake news has raised a big challenge to society. Automatic credibility analysis of news articles is a current research interest. Deep learning models are widely used for linguistic modeling. Typical deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) can detect complex patterns in textual data.

Such misinformation has the potential of affecting public opinion, providing an opportunity for malicious parties to manipulate the outcomes of public events such as elections. Because such high stakes are at play, automatically detecting fake news is an important, yet challenging problem that is not yet well understood. Nevertheless, there are three generally agreed upon characteristics of fake news: the text of an article, the user response it receives, and the source users promoting it. Existing work has largely focused on tailoring solutions to one particular characteristic which has limited their success and generality. In this work, we propose a model that combines all three characteristics for a more accurate and automated prediction. Specifically, we incorporate the behavior of both parties, users and articles, and the group behavior of users who propagate fake news. Motivated by the three characteristics, we propose a model called CSI which is composed of three modules: Capture, Score, and Integrate. The first module is based on the response and text; it uses a Recurrent Neural Network to capture the temporal pattern of user activity on a given article. The second module learns the source characteristic based on the behavior of users, and the two are integrated with the third module to classify an article as fake or not. Experimental analysis on real-world data demonstrates that CSI achieves higher accuracy than existing models, and extracts meaningful latent representations of both users and articles. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Deep learning; Fake news detection; Group anomaly detection; Neural networks; Social networks; Temporal analysis","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85037361396"

Understanding the reasoning behind certain fake items implies inferring a lot of details about the various actors involved. We believe that the solution to this problem should be a hybrid one, combining machine learning, semantics and natural language processing. We introduce a new semantic fake news detection method built around relational features like sentiment, entities or facts extracted directly from text. Our experiments show that by adding semantic features the accuracy of fake news classification improves significantly. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Deep learning; NLP; Relation Extraction; Semantics","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067488804"

On one hand, it is easy to access, less time consuming, user friendly, easily conveyable socially relevant news, possibility for obtaining various perspective of a single news and is being updated in every minute. On other hand, news is being manipulated by various networking sites based on private opinions or interest. Fake news is misinformation or manipulated news that is spread across the social media with an intention to damage a person, agency and organization. Due to the dissemination of fake news, there is need for computational methods to detect them. Fake news detection aims to help users to expose varieties of fabricated news. We can decide whether the news is solid or forged based on formerly witnessed fake or real news. We can use various models to access deceptive news in social media. Our contribution is bifold. First, we must introduce the datasets which contain both fake and real news and conduct various experiments to organize fake news detector. We use Natural Language Processing, Machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify the datasets. We yield a comprehensive audit of detecting fake news by including fake news categorization, existing algorithms from machine learning techniques. © 2018 IEEE.","Fake News; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Opinion Mining","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070373491"

On the other hand, it aggravates the prompt and wide spreading of fake news. Fake news may be fabricated for the purpose of, commercial gain, political propaganda, seeking attention, and intent of defamation. Interest of individuals, and various groups to influence events and policies around the globe is the other reason for fake news generation and dissemination. The extensive spread of fake news is progressively becoming a threat to individuals and society as a whole. It disrupts the authenticity balance of the news ecosystem; induces biased or false beliefs into consumers; creates real-life fears in the society and threatens freedom of speech, freedom of the press and democracy. The craving to mitigate the undesirable effects of fake news, recently makes fake news detection on social media an emerging research area attracting tremendous attention. Following this warm concern, various researches have been conducted and showed promising results. In this work, we propose a model for early detection of fake news using deep learning, and news content. Deep learning and heterogeneous dataset has been used to create a more generic model that could perform better in the real world. We conducted experiments on two real world datasets and a third dataset which is obtained by combining the two datasets and randomly shuffled them. Our experiment results have shown that early detection of fake news using news content and deep learning models, without waiting for news propagation, is achievable and should be given better attention to combat fake news effectively before it proliferates and misleads many people. The experimental results obtained are interesting. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Deep Learning; Fake News Detection; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Social Media","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074841428"

However, detecting fake news is challenging as they are intentionally written to mislead. Some current methods cannot detect fake news early and require external information like the source to assess articles. To tackle these challenges and improve the generalizability of the models, we adopted a text-based location-independent machine learning approach. It employed two types of machine learning models. The first is the bag-of-words model, made more robust by stacking two levels of models. The second is neural networks that utilize pre-trained GloVe word embeddings, including (a) one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) and (b) bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM). All models were assessed on various metrics (accuracy, recall, precision and F1), and achieved over 90% on the test set, making this an effective location-independent approach to detect fake news at an early stage without reliance on external information. © 2019 IEEE.","deep learning; Fake news; machine learning; natural language processing; text classification","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081345898"
